761,Towards a NMR implementation of a quantum lattice gas algorithm,"Recent theoretical results suggest that an array of quantum information processors communicating via classical channels can be used to solve fluid dynamics problems. Quantum lattice-gas algorithms (QLGA) running on such architectures have been shown to solve the diffusion equation and the nonlinear Burgers equations. In this report, we describe progress towards an ensemble nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) implementation of a QLGA that solves the diffusion equation. The methods rely on NMR techniques to encode an initial mass density into an ensemble of two-qubit quantum information processors. Using standard pulse techniques, the mass density can then manipulated and evolved through the steps of the algorithm. We provide the experimental results of our first attempt to realize the NMR implementation. The results qualitatively follow the ideal simulation, but the observed implementation errors highlight the need for improved control","['NMR implementation', 'quantum lattice gas algorithm', 'quantum information processors', 'fluid dynamics problems', 'diffusion equation', 'nonlinear Burgers equations', 'nuclear magnetic resonance', 'two-qubit quantum information.processors']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'M']",

1334,A shy invariant of graphs,"Moving from a well known result of P.L. Hammer et al. (1982), we introduce a new graph invariant, say lambda (G) referring to any graph G. It is a non-negative integer which is non-zero whenever G contains particular induced odd cycles or, equivalently, admits a particular minimum clique-partition. We show that).(G) can be efficiently evaluated and that its determination allows one to reduce the hard problem of computing a minimum clique-cover of a graph to an identical problem of smaller size and special structure. Furthermore, one has alpha (G) <or= theta (G) - lambda (G), where alpha (G) and theta (G) respectively denote the cardinality of a maximum stable set of G and of a minimum clique-partition of G","['graph invariant', 'induced odd cycles', 'minimum clique-partition', 'minimum clique-cover', 'cardinality', 'maximum stable set']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P']",

Dodd et al. [Phys. Rev. A 65, 040301(R) (2002)] provided a partial solution to this problem in the form of an efficient algorithm to simulate any desired two-body Hamiltonian evolution using any fixed two-body entangling N-qubit Hamiltonian, and local unitaries.

1035,H/sub 2/ optimization of the three-element type dynamic vibration absorbers,"The dynamic vibration absorber (DVA) is a passive vibration control device which is attached to a vibrating body (called a primary system) subjected to exciting force or motion. In this paper, we will discuss an optimization problem of the three-element type DVA on the basis of the H/sub 2/ optimization criterion. The objective of the H/sub 2/ optimization is to reduce the total vibration energy of the system for overall frequencies; the total area under the power spectrum response curve is minimized in this criterion. If the system is subjected to random excitation instead of sinusoidal excitation, then the H/sub 2/ optimization is probably more desirable than the popular H/sub infinity / optimization. In the past decade there has been increasing interest in the three-element type DVA. However, most previous studies on this type of DVA were based on the H/sub infinity / optimization design, and no one has been able to find the algebraic solution as of yet. We found a closed-form exact solution for a special case where the primary system has no damping. Furthermore, the general case solution including the damped primary system is presented in the form of a numerical solution. The optimum parameters obtained here are compared to those of the conventional Voigt type DVA. They are also compared to other optimum parameters based on the H/sub infinity / criterion","['H/sub 2/ optimization', 'three-element type dynamic vibration absorbers', 'passive vibration control', 'power spectrum response', 'Voigt type dynamic vibration absorber']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R']",

639,Distributed servers approach for large-scale secure multicast,"In order to offer backward and forward secrecy for multicast applications (i.e., a new member cannot decrypt the multicast data sent before its joining and a former member cannot decrypt the data sent after its leaving), the data encryption key has to be changed whenever a user joins or leaves the system. Such a change has to be made known to all the current users. The bandwidth used for such re-key messaging can be high when the user pool is large. We propose a distributed servers approach to minimize the overall system bandwidth (and complexity) by splitting the user pool into multiple groups each served by a (logical) server. After presenting an analytic model for the system based on a hierarchical key tree, we show that there is an optimal number of servers to achieve minimum system bandwidth. As the underlying user traffic fluctuates, we propose a simple dynamic scheme with low overhead where a physical server adaptively splits and merges its traffic into multiple groups each served by a logical server so as to minimize its total bandwidth. Our results show that a distributed servers approach is able to substantially reduce the total bandwidth required as compared with the traditional single-server approach, especially for those applications with a large user pool, short holding time, and relatively low bandwidth of a data stream, as in the Internet stock quote applications","['distributed servers', 'large-scale secure multicast', 'forward secrecy', 'multicast applications', 'data encryption key', 're-key messaging', 'system bandwidth', 'hierarchical key tree', 'user traffic', 'short holding time', 'Internet stock quote applications', 'backward secrecy', 'system complexity', 'traffic merging', 'dynamic split-and-merge scheme', 'key management']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'M', 'M']",

The evolutionary technique is applied to building dominant structural identification with local parametric tuning without the need of a differentiable performance index in the presence of noisy data. It is shown that the evolutionary technique provides an excellent fitting performance and is capable of accommodating multiple objectives such as to examine the relationships between model complexity and fitting accuracy during the model building process. Validation results show that the proposed method offers robust, uncluttered and accurate models for two practical systems.

641,Multiecho segmented EPI with z-shimmed background gradient compensation (MESBAC) pulse sequence for fMRI,"A MultiEcho Segmented EPI with z-shimmed BAckground gradient Compensation (MESBAC) pulse sequence is proposed and validated for functional MRI (fMRI) study in regions suffering from severe susceptibility artifacts. This sequence provides an effective tradeoff between spatial and temporal resolution and reduces image distortion and signal dropout. The blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD)-weighted fMRI signal can be reliably obtained in the region of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). To overcome physiological motion artifacts during prolonged multisegment EPI acquisition, two sets of navigator echoes were acquired in both the readout and phase-encoding directions. Ghost artifacts generally produced by single-shot EPI acquisition were eliminated by separately placing the even and odd echoes in different k-space trajectories. Unlike most z-shim methods that focus on increasing temporal resolution for event-related functional brain mapping, the MESBAC sequence simultaneously addresses problems of image distortion and signal dropout while maintaining sufficient temporal resolution. The MESBAC sequence will be particularly useful for pharmacological and affective fMRI studies in brain regions such as the OFC, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, para-hippocampus, etc","['multiecho segmented EPI', 'z-shimmed background gradient compensation', 'fMRI', 'severe susceptibility artifacts', 'temporal resolution', 'image distortion', 'signal dropout', 'orbitofrontal cortex', 'navigator echoes', 'ghost artifacts', 'event-related functional brain mapping', 'gradient compensation pulse sequence', 'BOLD-weighted signal', 'spatial resolution']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'M', 'R']",

The analysis and synthesis algorithms have linear time complexity. Depending on different weight parameters w, the scaling functions and wavelets generated by the four-point subdivision scheme are of different degrees of smoothness.

1150,Effect of multileaf collimator leaf width on physical dose distributions in the treatment of CNS and head and neck neoplasms with intensity modulated radiation therapy,"The purpose of this work is to examine physical radiation dose differences between two multileaf collimator (MLC) leaf widths (5 and 10 mm) in the treatment of CNS and head and neck neoplasms with intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Three clinical patients with CNS tumors were planned with two different MLC leaf sizes, 5 and 10 mm, representing Varian-120 and Varian-80 Millennium multileaf collimators, respectively. Two sets of IMRT treatment plans were developed. The goal of the first set was radiation dose conformality in three dimensions. The goal for the second set was organ avoidance of a nearby critical structure while maintaining adequate coverage of the target volume. Treatment planning utilized the CadPlan/Helios system (Varian Medical Systems, Milpitas CA) for dynamic MLC treatment delivery. All beam parameters and optimization (cost function) parameters were identical for the 5 and 10 mm plans. For all cases the number of beams, gantry positions, and table positions were taken from clinically treated three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy plans. Conformality was measured by the ratio of the planning isodose volume to the target volume. Organ avoidance was measured by the volume of the critical structure receiving greater than 90% of the prescription dose (V/sub 90/). For three patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (T2-T4 N0-N2c M0) 5 and 10 mm leaf widths were compared for parotid preservation utilizing nine coplanar equally spaced beams delivering a simultaneous integrated boost. Because modest differences in physical dose to the parotid were detected, a NTCP model based upon the clinical parameters of Eisbruch et al. was then used for comparisons. The conformality improved in all three CNS cases for the 5 mm plans compared to the 10 mm plans. For the organ avoidance plans, V/sub 90/ also improved in two of the three cases when the 5 mm leaf width was utilized for IMRT treatment delivery. In the third case, both the 5 and 10 mm plans were able to spare the critical structure with none of the structure receiving more than 90% of the prescription dose, but in the moderate dose range, less dose was delivered to the critical structure with the 5 mm plan. For the head and neck cases both the 5 and 10*2.5 mm beamlets dMLC sliding window techniques spared the contralateral parotid gland while maintaining target volume coverage. The mean parotid dose was modestly lower with the smaller beamlet size (21.04 Gy vs 22.36 Gy). The resulting average NTCP values were 13.72% for 10 mm dMLC and 8.24% for 5 mm dMLC. In conclusion, five mm leaf width results in an improvement in physical dose distribution over 10 mm leaf width that may be clinically relevant in some cases. These differences may be most pronounced for single fraction radiosurgery or in cases where the tolerance of the sensitive organ is less than or close to the target volume prescription","['multileaf collimator leaf width', 'physical dose distributions', 'head and neck neoplasms', 'intensity modulated radiation therapy', '10 mm', 'CNS tumors', 'treatment planning', 'conformal radiotherapy', 'parotid preservation', '5 mm', 'beamlet size', '21.04 Gy', '22.36 Gy', 'single fraction radiosurgery', 'CNS neoplasms', 'optimization parameters', 'acceptable tumor coverage', 'minimal toxicity', 'collimator rotation']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'R', 'M', 'U', 'M']",

Ventilation and perfusion images were simultaneously acquired using the flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) method as volunteers alternately inhaled room air and 100% oxygen. Images of the T/sub 1/ distribution were calculated for five volunteers for both selective (T/sub 1f/) and nonselective (T/sub 1/) inversion. The average T/sub 1/ was 1360 ms+or-116 ms, and the average T/sub 1f/ was 1012 ms+or-112 ms, yielding a difference that is statistically significant (P<0.002). Excluding large pulmonary vessels, the average V/Q SI ratios were 0.355+or-0.073 for the left lung and 0.371+or-0.093 for the right lung, which are in agreement with the theoretical V/Q SI ratio. Plots of the WO SI ratio are similar to the logarithmic normal distribution obtained by multiple inert gas elimination techniques, with a range of ratios matching ventilation and perfusion.

To facilitate adoption of this RT method by industry, a comprehensive PEL tooling development system is proposed. The two main parts of this system are: (1) iterative tool design based on thermal and structural models; and (2) fabrication of the tool using a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software and abrasive water jet cutting. CAM software has been developed to take lamination slice data (profiles) from any proprietary RP software in the form of polylines and create smooth, kinematically desirable cutting trajectories for each tool lamination. Two cutting trajectory algorithms, called identical equidistant profile segmentation and adaptively vector profiles projection (AVPP), were created for this purpose. By comparing the performance of both algorithms with a benchmark part shape, the AVPP algorithm provided better cutting trajectories for complicated tool geometries.

Species concentrations in both phases are modified by chemical reactions and by this phase transfer. The model equations resulting from such multiphase chemical systems are nonlinear, highly coupled and extremely stiff. In the paper we investigate several numerical approaches for treating such processes. The droplets are subdivided into several classes. This decomposition of the droplet spectrum into classes is based on their droplet size and the amount of scavenged material inside the drops, respectively. The very fast dissociations in the aqueous phase chemistry are treated as forward and backward reactions. The aqueous phase and gas phase chemistry, the mass transfer between the different droplet classes among themselves and with the gas phase are integrated in an implicit and coupled manner by the second order BDF method. For this part we apply a modification of the code LSODE with special linear system solvers. These direct sparse techniques exploit the special block structure of the corresponding Jacobian. Furthermore we investigate an approximate matrix factorization which is related to operator splitting at the linear algebra level.

62,Text-independent speaker verification using utterance level scoring and covariance modeling,"This paper describes a computationally simple method to perform text independent speaker verification using second order statistics. The suggested method, called utterance level scoring (ULS), allows one to obtain a normalized score using a single pass through the frames of the tested utterance. The utterance sample covariance is first calculated and then compared to the speaker covariance using a distortion measure.

In keeping with the need to implement very-high-power inverters, switching frequency is restricted to line frequency. The study addresses device count, DC filter ratings, restrictions on voltage control, active power transfer through the DC link, and balancing of DC-link voltages. Emphasis is placed on capacitor sizing because of its impact on the cost and size of the FACTS controller. A method for the dimensioning the DC capacitor filter is presented. It is found that the chain converter is attractive for the implementation of a static compensator or a static synchronous series compensator.

1056,Eliminating recency with self-review: the case of auditors' 'going concern' judgments,"This paper examines the use of self-review to debias recency. Recency is found in the 'going concern' judgments of staff auditors, but is successfully eliminated by the auditor's use of a simple self-review technique that would be extremely easy to implement in audit practice. Auditors who self-review are also less inclined to make audit report choices that are inconsistent with their going concern judgments. These results are important because the judgments of staff auditors often determine the type and extent of documentation in audit workpapers and serve as preliminary inputs for senior auditors' judgments and choices. If staff auditors' judgments are affected by recency, the impact of this bias may be impounded in the ultimate judgments and choices of senior auditors. Since biased judgments can expose auditors to significant costs involving extended audit procedures, legal liability and diminished reputation, simple debiasing techniques that reduce this exposure are valuable.

60,Perceptual audio coding using adaptive pre- and post-filters and lossless compression,"This paper proposes a versatile perceptual audio coding method that achieves high compression ratios and is capable of low encoding/decoding delay. It accommodates a variety of source signals (including both music and speech) with different sampling rates. It is based on separating irrelevance and redundancy reductions into independent functional units. This contrasts traditional audio coding where both are integrated within the same subband decomposition. The separation allows for the independent optimization of the irrelevance and redundancy reduction units. For both reductions, we rely on adaptive filtering and predictive coding as much as possible to minimize the delay. A psycho-acoustically controlled adaptive linear filter is used for the irrelevance reduction, and the redundancy reduction is carried out by a predictive lossless coding scheme, which is termed weighted cascaded least mean squared (WCLMS) method. Experiments are carried out on a database of moderate size which contains mono-signals of different sampling rates and varying nature (music, speech, or mixed). They show that the proposed WCLMS lossless coder outperforms other competing lossless coders in terms of compression ratios and delay, as applied to the pre-filtered signal. Moreover, a subjective listening test of the combined pre-filter/lossless coder and a state-of-the-art perceptual audio coder (PAC) shows that the new method achieves a comparable compression ratio and audio quality with a lower delay","['perceptual audio coding', 'lossless compression', 'high compression ratio', 'low encoding/decoding delay', 'source signals', 'music', 'sampling rates', 'redundancy reduction', 'adaptive filtering', 'predictive coding', 'psycho-acoustically controlled adaptive linear filter', 'irrelevance reduction', 'predictive lossless coding', 'weighted cascaded least mean squared', 'WCLMS lossless coder', 'subjective listening test', 'pre-filter/lossless coder', 'audio quality', 'adaptive pre-filters', 'adaptive post-filters']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'R']",

One of the most promising active rotorcraft vibration control systems is an active trailing edge flap. In this paper, an induced-shear piezoelectric tube actuator is used in conjunction with a simple lever-cusp hinge amplification device to generate a useful combination of trailing edge flap deflections and hinge moments. A finite-element model of the actuator tube and trailing edge flap (including aerodynamic and inertial loading) was used to guide the design of the actuator-flap system. A full-scale induced shear tube actuator flap system was fabricated and bench top testing was conducted to validate the analysis. Hinge moments corresponding to various rotor speeds were applied to the actuator using mechanical springs. The testing demonstrated that for an applied electric field of 3 kV cm/sup -1/ the tube actuator deflected a representative full-scale 12 inch flap +or-2.8 degrees at 0 rpm and +or-1.4 degrees for a hinge moment simulating a 400 rpm condition. The per cent error between the predicted and experimental full-scale flap deflections ranged from 4% (low rpm) to 12.5% (large rpm). Increasing the electric field to 4 kV cm/sup -1/ results in +or-2.5 degrees flap deflection at a rotation speed of 400 rpm, according to the design analysis.

1133,An analytic center cutting plane method for semidefinite feasibility problems,"Semidefinite feasibility problems arise in many areas of operations research.

Assume that Gamma is defined by an oracle, which for any given m * m symmetric positive semidefinite matrix Gamma either confirms that Y epsilon Gamma or returns a cut, i.e., a symmetric matrix A such that Gamma is in the half-space {Y : A . Y <or= A . Y}. We study an analytic center cutting plane algorithm for this problem. At each iteration, the algorithm computes an approximate analytic center of a working set defined by the cutting plane system generated in the previous iterations. If this approximate analytic center is a solution, then the algorithm terminates; otherwise the new cutting plane returned by the oracle is added into the system. As the number of iterations increases, the working set shrinks and the algorithm eventually finds a solution to the problem. All iterates generated by the algorithm are positive definite matrices.

With exact causal dependency relations between messages considered in the model, this algorithm can avoid state space explosion caused by asynchronous composition. In order to get a finite state space, a new method called strand-added on demand is exploited, which extends a bundle in an incremental manner without requiring explicit configuration of protocol execution parameters. A finer granularity model of term structure is also introduced, in which subterms are divided into check subterms and data subterms. Moreover, data subterms can be further classified based on the compatible data subterm relation to obtain automatically the finite set of valid acceptable terms for an honest principal.

1152,Incorporating multi-leaf collimator leaf sequencing into iterative IMRT optimization,"Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment planning typically considers beam optimization and beam delivery as separate tasks. Following optimization, a multi-leaf collimator (MLC) or other beam delivery device is used to generate fluence patterns for patient treatment delivery. Due to limitations and characteristics of the MLC, the deliverable intensity distributions often differ from those produced by the optimizer, leading to differences between the delivered and the optimized doses. Objective function parameters are then adjusted empirically, and the plan is reoptimized to achieve a desired deliverable dose distribution. The resulting plan, though usually acceptable, may not be the best achievable. A method has been developed to incorporate the MLC restrictions into the optimization process. Our in-house IMRT system has been modified to include the calculation of the deliverable intensity into the optimizer. In this process, prior to dose calculation, the MLC leaf sequencer is used to convert intensities to dynamic MLC sequences, from which the deliverable intensities are then determined. All other optimization steps remain the same. To evaluate the effectiveness of deliverable-based optimization, 17 patient cases have been studied. Compared with standard optimization plus conversion to deliverable beams, deliverable-based optimization results show improved isodose coverage and a reduced dose to critical structures. Deliverable-based optimization results are close to the original nondeliverable optimization results, suggesting that IMRT can overcome the MLC limitations by adjusting individual beamlets. The use of deliverable-based optimization may reduce the need for empirical adjustment of objective function parameters and reoptimization of a plan to achieve desired results","['intensity modulated radiation therapy', 'treatment planning', 'beam optimization', 'beam delivery', 'fluence patterns', 'objective function parameters', 'deliverable dose distribution', 'empirical adjustment', 'iterative optimization', 'multileaf collimator leaf sequencing', 'tumor dose', 'optimized intensity', 'gradient-based search algorithm', 'beamlet ray intensities', 'Newton method', 'dose-volume objective values']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'M', 'M', 'R', 'U', 'M', 'M', 'M']",

542,The treatment of fear of flying: a controlled study of imaginal and virtual reality graded exposure therapy,"The goal of this study was to determine if virtual reality graded exposure therapy (VRGET) was equally efficacious, more efficacious, or less efficacious, than imaginal exposure therapy in the treatment of fear of flying. Thirty participants (Age=39.8+or-9.7) with confirmed DSM-IV diagnosis of specific phobia fear of flying were randomly assigned to one of three groups: VRGET with no physiological feedback (VRGETno), VRGET with physiological feedback (VRGETpm), or systematic desensitization with imaginal exposure therapy (IET). Eight sessions were conducted once a week. During each session, physiology was measured to give an objective measurement of improvement over the course of exposure therapy. In addition, self-report questionnaires, subjective ratings of anxiety (SUDs), and behavioral observations (included here as flying behavior before beginning treatment and at a three-month posttreatment followup) were included. In the analysis of results, the Chi-square test of behavioral observations based on a three-month posttreatment followup revealed a statistically significant difference in flying behavior between the groups [ chi /sup 2/(4)=19.41, p<0.001]. Only one participant (10%) who received IET, eight of the ten participants (80%) who received VRGETno, and ten out of the ten participants (100%) who received VRGETpm reported an ability to fly without medication or alcohol at three-month followup. Although this study included small sample sizes for the three groups, the results showed VRGET was more effective than IET in the treatment of flying.

643,Time-resolved contrast-enhanced imaging with isotropic resolution and broad coverage using an undersampled 3D projection trajectory,"Time-resolved contrast-enhanced 3D MR angiography (MRA) methods have gained in popularity but are still limited by the tradeoff between spatial and temporal resolution. A method is presented that greatly reduces this tradeoff by employing undersampled 3D projection reconstruction trajectories. The variable density k-space sampling intrinsic to this sequence is combined with temporal k-space interpolation to provide time frames as short as 4 s. This time resolution reduces the need for exact contrast timing while also providing dynamic information. Spatial resolution is determined primarily by the projection readout resolution and is thus isotropic across the FOV, which is also isotropic. Although undersampling the outer regions of k-space introduces aliased energy into the image, which may compromise resolution, this is not a limiting factor in high-contrast applications such as MRA. Results from phantom and volunteer studies are presented demonstrating isotropic resolution, broad coverage with an isotropic field of view (FOV), minimal projection reconstruction artifacts, and temporal information.

1257,Definition of a similarity measure between cases based on auto/cross-fuzzy thesauri,"A similarity measure between cases is needed in order to evaluate the degree of similarity when using past similar cases in order to resolve current problems. In similar case retrieval, multiple indices are set up in order to characterize the queries and individual cases, then terms are given as values to each. The similarity measure between cases commonly used is defined using the rate at which the values provided from the corresponding indices match. In practice, however, values cannot be expected to be mutually exclusive. As a result, a natural expansion of this approach is to have relationships in which mutually similar meanings are reflected in the similarity measure between cases. In this paper the authors consider an auto-fuzzy thesaurus which gives the relationship for values between corresponding indices and a cross-fuzzy thesaurus which gives the relationship for values between mutually distinct indices, then defines a similarity measure between cases which considers the relationship of index values based on these thesauri. This definition satisfies the characteristics required for the operation of case-based retrieval even when one value is not necessarily given in the index.

The subjects consisted of 12 patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma and 9 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) who were treated with radical radiotherapy between July 1999 and February 2001. Image fusion between /sup 18/FDG-PET and MRI/CT was performed using an automatic multimodality image registration algorithm, which used the brain as an internal reference for registration. Gross tumor volume (GTV) was determined based on clinical examination and /sup 18/FDG uptake on the fusion images. Clinical target volume (CTV) was determined following the usual pattern of lymph node spread for each disease entity along with the clinical presentation of each patient. Except for 3 cases with superficial tumors, all the other primary tumors were detected by /sup 18/FDG-PET. The GTV volumes for primary tumors were not changed by image fusion in 19 cases (89%), increased by 49% in one NPC, and decreased by 45% in another NPC. Normal tissue sparing was more easily performed based on clearer GTV and CTV determination on the fusion images. In particular, parotid sparing became possible in 15 patients (71%) whose upper neck areas near the parotid glands were tumor-free by /sup 18/FDG-PET. Within a mean follow-up period of 18 months, no recurrence occurred in the areas defined as CTV, which was treated prophylactically, except for 1 patient who experienced nodal recurrence in the CTV and simultaneous primary site recurrence. In conclusion, this preliminary study showed that image fusion between /sup 18/FDG-PET and MRI/CT was useful in GTV and CTV determination in conformal RT, thus sparing normal tissues","['image fusion', '/sup 18/FDG-PET', 'MRI/CT', 'radiotherapy planning', 'nasopharyngeal carcinomas', 'oropharyngeal carcinomas', 'superficial tumors', 'primary tumors', 'normal tissues sparing', 'parotid glands', 'simultaneous primary site recurrence', 'F']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'U']",

In a word spotting experiment with a vocabulary of 240 keywords, the keyword accuracy under the AP measure is above 94%, which well approaches its theoretical upper limit.

1156,Favorable noise uniformity properties of Fourier-based interpolation and reconstruction approaches in single-slice helical computed tomography,"Volumes reconstructed by standard methods from single-slice helical computed tomography (CT) data have been shown to have noise levels that are highly nonuniform relative to those in conventional CT. These noise nonuniformities can affect low-contrast object detectability and have also been identified as the cause of the zebra artifacts that plague maximum intensity projection (MIP) images of such volumes. While these spatially variant noise levels have their root in the peculiarities of the helical scan geometry, there is also a strong dependence on the interpolation and reconstruction algorithms employed. In this paper, we seek to develop image reconstruction strategies that eliminate or reduce, at its source, the nonuniformity of noise levels in helical CT relative to that in conventional CT. We pursue two approaches, independently and in concert. We argue, and verify, that Fourier-based longitudinal interpolation approaches lead to more uniform noise ratios than do the standard 360LI and 180LI approaches. We also demonstrate that a Fourier-based fan-to-parallel rebinning algorithm, used as an alternative to fanbeam filtered backprojection for slice reconstruction, also leads to more uniform noise ratios, even when making use of the 180LI and 360LI interpolation approaches","['noise uniformity properties', 'Fourier-based interpolation', 'reconstruction approaches', 'single-slice helical computed tomography', 'conventional CT', 'low-contrast object detectability', 'zebra artifacts', 'more uniform noise ratios', 'Fourier-based fan-to-parallel rebinning algorithm', 'medical diagnostic imaging', 'maximum intensity projection images', 'helical span geometry']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'M', 'R', 'M']",
991,Estimation of blocking probabilities in cellular networks with dynamic channel assignment,"Blocking probabilities in cellular mobile communication networks using dynamic channel assignment are hard to compute for realistic sized systems. This computational difficulty is due to the structure of the state space, which imposes strong coupling constraints amongst components of the occupancy vector. Approximate tractable models have been proposed, which have product form stationary state distributions. However, for real channel assignment schemes, the product form is a poor approximation and it is necessary to simulate the actual occupancy process in order to estimate the blocking probabilities. Meaningful estimates of the blocking probability typically require an enormous amount of CPU time for simulation, since blocking events are usually rare. Advanced simulation approaches use importance sampling (IS) to overcome this problem. We study two regimes under which blocking is a rare event: low-load and high cell capacity. Our simulations use the standard clock (SC) method. For low load, we propose a change of measure that we call static ISSC, which has bounded relative error. For high capacity, we use a change of measure that depends on the current state of the network occupancy. This is the dynamic ISSC method. We prove that this method yields zero variance estimators for single clique models, and we empirically show the advantages of this method over naive simulation for networks of moderate size and traffic loads","['dynamic channel assignment', 'cellular mobile communication networks', 'strong coupling constraints', 'occupancy vector', 'approximate tractable models', 'product form stationary state distributions', 'simulation', 'CPU time', 'importance sampling', 'low-load', 'high cell capacity', 'bounded relative error', 'dynamic ISSC method', 'zero variance estimators', 'single clique models', 'blocking probability estimation', 'standard clock method', 'static ISSC method', 'quality of service', 'network traffic load']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'M', 'R']",

586,A strategy for a payoff-switching differential game based on fuzzy reasoning,"In this paper, a new concept of a payoff-switching differential game is introduced. In this new game, any one player at any time may have several choices of payoffs for the future. Moreover, the payoff-switching process, including the time of payoff switching and the outcome payoff, of any one player is unknown to the other. Indeed, the overall payoff, which is a sequence of several payoffs, is unknown until the game ends. An algorithm for determining a reasoning strategy based on fuzzy reasoning is proposed. In this algorithm, the fuzzy theory is used to estimate the behavior of one player during a past time interval. By deriving two fuzzy matrices GSM, game similarity matrix, and VGSM, variation of GSM, the behavior of the player can be quantified. Two weighting vectors are selected to weight the relative importance of the player's behavior at each past time instant. Finally a simple fuzzy inference rule is adopted to generate a linear reasoning strategy. The advantage of this algorithm is that it provides a flexible way for differential game specialists to convert their knowledge into a ""reasonable"" strategy.

1196,Multiple shooting using a dichotomically stable integrator for solving differential-algebraic equations,"In previous work by the first author, it has been established that a dichotomically stable discretization is needed when solving a stiff boundary-value problem in ordinary differential equations (ODEs), when sharp boundary layers may occur at each end of the interval. A dichotomically stable implicit Runge-Kutta method, using the 3-stage, fourth-order, Lobatto IIIA formulae, has been implemented in a variable step-size initial-value integrator, which could be used in a multiple-shooting approach. In the case of index-one differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) the use of the Lobatto IIIA formulae has an advantage, over a comparable Gaussian method, that the order is the same for both differential and algebraic variables, and there is no need to treat them separately. The ODE integrator has been adapted for the solution of index-one DAEs, and the resulting integrator (SYMDAE) has been inserted into the multiple-shooting code (MSHDAE) previously developed by R. Lamour for differential-algebraic boundary-value problems. The standard version of MSHDAE uses a BDF integrator, which is not dichotomically stable, and for some stiff test problems this fails to integrate across the interval of interest, while the dichotomically stable integrator SYMDAE encounters no difficulty. Indeed, for such problems, the modified version of MSHDAE produces an accurate solution, and within limits imposed by computer word length, the efficiency of the solution process improves with increasing stiffness. For some nonstiff problems, the solution is also entirely satisfactory","['multiple shooting', 'dichotomically stable integrator', 'differential-algebraic equations', 'stiff boundary-value problem', 'ordinary differential equations', 'implicit Runge-Kutta method', 'Lobatto IIIA formulae', 'initial-value integrator']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P']",

1316,Understanding Internet traffic streams: dragonflies and tortoises,"We present the concept of network traffic streams and the ways they aggregate into flows through Internet links. We describe a method of measuring the size and lifetime of Internet streams, and use this method to characterize traffic distributions at two different sites. We find that although most streams (about 45 percent of them) are dragonflies, lasting less than 2 seconds, a significant number of streams have lifetimes of hours to days, and can carry a high proportion (50-60 percent) of the total bytes on a given link. We define tortoises as streams that last longer than 15 minutes. We point out that streams can be classified not only by lifetime (dragonflies and tortoises) but also by size (mice and elephants), and note that stream size and lifetime are independent dimensions. We submit that ISPs need to be aware of the distribution of Internet stream sizes, and the impact of the difference in behavior between short and long streams. In particular, any forwarding cache mechanisms in Internet routers must be able to cope with a high volume of short streams. In addition ISPs should realize that long-running streams can contribute a significant fraction of their packet and byte volumes-something they may not have allowed for when using traditional ""flat rate user bandwidth consumption"" approaches to provisioning and engineering","['Internet traffic streams', 'dragonflies', 'tortoises', 'network traffic streams', 'traffic distributions', 'mice', 'elephants', 'ISP', 'forwarding cache mechanisms', 'Internet routers', 'long-running streams', 'Internet stream size measurement', 'Internet stream lifetime measurement', 'packet volume', 'byte volume', 'traffic provisioning', 'traffic engineering']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'R']",

1092,Ride quality evaluation of an actively-controlled stretcher for an ambulance,"This study considers the subjective evaluation of ride quality during ambulance transportation using an actively-controlled stretcher (ACS). The ride quality of a conventional stretcher and an assistant driver's seat is also compared. Braking during ambulance transportation generates negative foot-to-head acceleration in patients and causes blood pressure to rise in the patient's head. The ACS absorbs the foot-to-head acceleration by changing the angle of the stretcher, thus reducing the blood pressure variation. However, the ride quality of the ACS should be investigated further because the movement of the ACS may cause motion sickness and nausea. Experiments of ambulance transportation, including rapid acceleration and deceleration, are performed to evaluate the effect of differences in posture of the transported subject on the ride quality; the semantic differential method and factor analysis are used in the investigations. Subjects are transported using a conventional stretcher with head forward, a conventional stretcher with head backward, the ACS, and an assistant driver's seat for comparison with transportation using a stretcher. Experimental results show that the ACS gives the most comfortable transportation when using a stretcher. Moreover, the reduction of the negative foot-to-head acceleration at frequencies below 0.2 Hz and the small variation of the foot-to-head acceleration result in more comfortable transportation. Conventional transportation with the head forward causes the worst transportation, although the characteristics of the vibration of the conventional stretcher seem to be superior to that of the ACS","['ride quality evaluation', 'actively-controlled stretcher', 'ambulance', 'subjective evaluation', 'ambulance transportation', 'conventional stretcher', 'braking', 'negative foot-to-head acceleration', 'blood pressure variation', 'motion sickness', 'nausea', 'rapid acceleration', 'transported subject', 'semantic differential method', 'factor analysis', 'head forward', 'head backward', 'comfortable transportation', 'vibration', 'assistant driver seat', 'patient head', 'stretcher angle', 'rapid deceleration', 'posture differences']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'R']",

Under different cutting conditions, cutting and indenting-cutting tests are carried out by single point cutting tools and single diamond segments. The results indicate that the depth of cut per diamond grit increases as the blades move forward. Only a few grits per segment can remove the material in the cutting process. When the direction of the stroke changes, the cutting forces do not decrease to zero because of the residual plastic deformation beneath the diamond grits. The plastic deformation and fracture chipping of material are the dominant removal processes, which can be explained by the fracture theory of brittle material indentation","['marble cutting', 'single point cutting tool', 'diamond segments', 'frame sawing', 'kinematic behaviour', 'indenting-cutting tests', 'residual plastic deformation', 'fracture chipping', 'removal processes', 'fracture theory', 'brittle material indentation', 'cutting tests']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R']",

Thus parallel computing is still unpopular in the computational science community, even though parallel programming is common to the computer science community. As users would like to run the same source code on parallel machines with different architectures as fast as possible, we have investigated the compatibility of source codes for Japanese HPF compilers (NEC, Fujitsu and Hitachi) with two real-world applications: a 3D fluid code and a 2D particle code. We have found that the source-level compatibility between Japanese HPF compilers is almost preserved, but more effort will be needed to sustain complete compatibility. We have also evaluated parallel performance and found that HPF can achieve good performance for the 3D fluid code with almost the same source code. For the 2D particle code, good results have also been obtained with a small number of processors, but some changes in the original source code and the addition of interface blocks is required","['HPF', 'compilers', 'High-Performance Fortran', 'portable programs', 'parallel programming', 'parallel performance', 'source compatability']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R']",
1273,Towards an ontology of approximate reason,"This article introduces structural aspects in an ontology of approximate reason. The basic assumption in this ontology is that approximate reason is a capability of an agent. Agents are designed to classify information granules derived from sensors that respond to stimuli in the environment of an agent or received from other agents. Classification of information granules is carried out in the context of parameterized approximation spaces and a calculus of granules. Judgment in agents is a faculty of thinking about (classifying) the particular relative to decision rules derived from data. Judgment in agents is reflective, but not in the classical philosophical sense (e.g., the notion of judgment in Kant). In an agent, a reflective judgment itself is an assertion that a particular decision rule derived from data is applicable to an object (input). That is, a reflective judgment by an agent is an assertion that a particular vector of attribute (sensor) values matches to some degree the conditions for a particular rule. In effect, this form of judgment is an assertion that a vector of sensor values reflects a known property of data expressed by a decision rule. Since the reasoning underlying a reflective judgment is inductive and surjective (not based on a priori conditions or universals), this form of judgment is reflective, but not in the sense of Kant. Unlike Kant, a reflective judgment is surjective in the sense that it maps experimental attribute values onto the most closely matching descriptors (conditions) in a derived rule. Again, unlike Kant's notion of judgment, a reflective judgment is not the result of searching for a universal that pertains to a particular set of values of descriptors. Rather, a reflective judgment by an agent is a form of recognition that a particular vector of sensor values pertains to a particular rule in some degree. This recognition takes the form of an assertion that a particular descriptor vector is associated with a particular decision rule. These considerations can be repeated for other forms of classifiers besides those defined by decision rules","['ontology', 'approximate reason', 'information granules', 'granules', 'parameterized approximation spaces', 'decision rules', 'reflective judgment', 'pattern recognition', 'rough sets']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'M', 'M']",
626,Approximate confidence intervals for one proportion and difference of two proportions,"Constructing a confidence interval for a binomial proportion or the difference of two proportions is a routine exercise in daily data analysis. The best-known method is the Wald interval based on the asymptotic normal approximation to the distribution of the observed sample proportion, though it is known to have bad performance for small to medium sample sizes. Agresti et al. (1998, 2000) proposed an Adding-4 method: 4 pseudo-observations are added with 2 successes and 2 failures and then the resulting (pseudo-)sample proportion is used. The method is simple and performs extremely well. Here we propose an approximate method based on a t-approximation that takes account of the uncertainty in estimating the variance of the observed (pseudo-)sample proportion. It follows the same line of using a t-test, rather than z-test, in testing the mean of a normal distribution with an unknown variance. For some circumstances our proposed method has a higher coverage probability than the Adding-4 method","['approximate confidence intervals', 'difference of two proportions', 'binomial proportion', 'data analysis', 't-approximation', 'uncertainty', 't-test', 'normal distribution', 'coverage probability', 'variance estimation', 'pseudo-sample proportion']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'M']",
59,Efficient tracking of the cross-correlation coefficient,"In many (audio) processing algorithms, involving manipulation of discrete-time signals, the performance can vary strongly over the repertoire that is used. This may be the case when the signals from the various channels are allowed to be strongly positively or negatively correlated. We propose and analyze a general formula for tracking the (time-dependent) correlation between two signals. Some special cases of this formula lead to classical results known from the literature, others are new. This formula is recursive in nature, and uses only the instantaneous values of the two signals, in a low-cost and low-complexity manner; in particular, there is no need to take square roots or to carry out divisions. Furthermore, this formula can be modified with respect to the occurrence of the two signals so as to further decrease the complexity, and increase ease of implementation. The latter modification comes at the expense that not the actual correlation is tracked, but, rather, a somewhat deformed version of it. To overcome this problem, we propose, for a number of instances of the tracking formula, a simple warping operation on the deformed correlation. Now we obtain, at least for sinusoidal signals, the correct value of the correlation coefficient. Special attention is paid to the convergence behavior of the algorithm for stationary signals and the dynamic behavior if there is a transition to another stationary state; the latter is considered to be important to study the tracking abilities to nonstationary signals. We illustrate tracking algorithm by using it for stereo music fragments, obtained from a number of digital audio recordings","['efficient tracking', 'cross-correlation coefficient', 'discrete-time signals', 'warping operation', 'deformed correlation', 'sinusoidal signals', 'convergence behavior', 'stationary signals', 'dynamic behavior', 'stationary state', 'nonstationary signals', 'tracking algorithm', 'stereo music fragments', 'digital audio recording', 'audio processing algorithms', 'time-dependent correlation', 'recursive formula']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'R', 'R']",

1441,"Handles and exception safety, Part 1. A simple handle class","Every C++ program that uses inheritance must manage memory somehow. The most obvious way to do so is directly, but programmers who create complicated data structures often have trouble figuring out what parts of those data structures are safe to delete when. The classical method of dealing with such complexity is to hide it in a class. Such classes are typically called handles; the idea is to attach a handle object to another object that contains the actual data. The simplest form of a handle, which we have discussed in this article, is one in which each handle object corresponds to a single object from the inheritance hierarchy. Such handles are straightforward to use and to implement and tend to be intrinsically exception safe in almost all respects. The one exception hazard in such a class is typically the assignment operator. Assignment operators often test for self-assignment to avoid aliasing problems. As Herb Sutter has observed (2000), programs that need such tests are almost always exception unsafe. By rewriting the assignment operator, we ensure that we do not do anything irrevocable until the possibility of throwing an exception has passed. This strategy ensures that if an exception occurs while our assignment operator is executing, we do not corrupt the rest of our system","['handles', 'exception', 'C++ program', 'inheritance hierarchy', 'assignment operator', 'self-assignment', 'aliasing problems']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P']",

1234,Achieving performance under OpenMP on ccNUMA and software distributed shared memory systems,"OpenMP is emerging as a viable high-level programming model for shared memory parallel systems. It was conceived to enable easy, portable application development on this range of systems, and it has also been implemented on cache-coherent Non-Uniform Memory Access (ccNUMA) architectures. Unfortunately, it is hard to obtain high performance on the latter architecture, particularly when large numbers of threads are involved. In this paper, we discuss the difficulties faced when writing OpenMP programs for ccNUMA systems, and explain how the vendors have attempted to overcome them. We focus on one such system, the SGI Origin 2000, and perform a variety of experiments designed to illustrate the impact of the vendor's efforts. We compare codes written in a standard, loop-level parallel style under OpenMP with alternative versions written in a Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) fashion, also realized via OpenMP, and show that the latter consistently provides superior performance. A carefully chosen set of language extensions can help us translate programs from the former style to the latter (or to compile directly, but in a similar manner). Syntax for these extensions can be borrowed from HPF, and some aspects of HPF compiler technology can help the translation process. It is our expectation that an extended language, if well compiled, would improve the attractiveness of OpenMP as a language for high-performance computation on an important class of modern architectures","['OpenMP', 'programming model', 'shared memory parallel systems', 'cache-coherent Non-Uniform Memory Access', 'Single Program Multiple Data', 'HPF', 'parallel programming']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R']",

We have previously applied this method to semiparametric shared gamma frailty models, and verified by simulations the asymptotic and small sample statistical properties of the frailty variance estimates. Let theta /sub 0/ be the true value of the frailty variance parameter. Then the asymptotic distribution is normal for theta /sub 0/>0 while it is a 50-50 mixture between a point mass at zero and a normal random variable on the positive axis for theta /sub 0/=0. For small samples, simulations suggest that the frailty variance estimates are approximately distributed as an x-(100-x)% mixture, 0<or=x<or=50, between a point mass at zero and a normal random variable on the positive axis even for theta /sub 0/>0. We apply this method and verify by simulations these statistical results for semiparametric shared log-normal frailty models.

1135,"A combinatorial, graph-based solution method for a class of continuous-time optimal control problems","The paper addresses a class of continuous-time, optimal control problems whose solutions are typically characterized by both bang-bang and ""singular"" control regimes. Analytical study and numerical computation of such solutions are very difficult and far from complete when only techniques from control theory are used. This paper solves optimal control problems by reducing them to the combinatorial search for the shortest path in a specially constructed graph. Since the nodes of the graph are weighted in a sequence-dependent manner, we extend the classical, shortest-path algorithm to our case. The proposed solution method is currently limited to single-state problems with multiple control functions.

1170,Upper bound analysis of oblique cutting with nose radius tools,"A generalized upper bound model for calculating the chip flow angle in oblique cutting using flat-faced nose radius tools is described. The projection of the uncut chip area on the rake face is divided into a number of elements parallel to an assumed chip flow direction. The length of each of these elements is used to find the length of the corresponding element on the shear surface using the ratio of the shear velocity to the chip velocity. The area of each element is found as the cross product of the length and its width along the cutting edge. Summing up the area of the elements along the shear surface, the total shear surface area is obtained. The friction area is calculated using the similarity between orthogonal and oblique cutting in the 'equivalent' plane that includes both the cutting velocity and chip velocity. The cutting power is obtained by summing the shear power and the friction power. The actual chip flow angle and chip velocity are obtained by minimizing the cutting power with respect to both these variables.

134,A model of periodic oscillation for genetic regulatory systems,"In this paper, we focus on modeling and explaining periodic oscillations in gene-protein systems with a simple nonlinear model and on analyzing effects of time delay on the stability of oscillations. Our main model of genetic regulation comprises of a two-gene system with an autoregulatory feedback loop. We exploit multiple time scales and hysteretic properties of the model to construct periodic oscillations with jumping dynamics and analyze the possible mechanism according to the singular perturbation theory. As shown in this paper, periodic oscillations are mainly generated by nonlinearly negative and positive feedback loops in gene regulatory systems, whereas the jumping dynamics is generally caused by time scale differences among biochemical reactions. This simple model may actually act as a genetic oscillator or switch in gene-protein networks because the dynamics are robust for parameter perturbations or environment variations. We also explore effects of time delay on the stability of the dynamics, showing that the time delay generally increases the stability region of the oscillations, thereby making the oscillations robust to parameter changes.

Yet in many high-level languages, a mechanism for writing efficient reductions remains surprisingly absent. Further, when such mechanisms do exist, they often do not provide the flexibility a programmer needs to achieve a desirable level of performance. In this paper, we present a new language construct for arbitrary reductions that lets a programmer achieve a level of performance equal to that achievable with the highly flexible, but low-level combination of Fortran and MPI. We have implemented this construct in the ZPL language and evaluate it in the context of the initialization of the NAS MG benchmark. We show a 45 times speedup over the same code written in ZPL without this construct. In addition, performance on a large number of processors surpasses that achieved in the NAS implementation showing that our mechanism provides programmers with the needed flexibility","['reductions', 'parallel supercomputers', 'clusters of workstations', 'language construct', 'parallel programming', 'scientific computing']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'M', 'M']",

Then, we propose an impact analysis technique that is based on dependencies that exist among the components of database applications. This analysis leads to selecting test cases from the initial test suite for regression testing the modified application. In phase 2, further reduction in the regression test cases is performed by using reduction algorithms. We present two such algorithms. The Graph Walk algorithm walks through the control flow graph of database modules and selects a safe set of test cases to retest. The Call Graph Firewall algorithm uses a firewall for the inter procedural level. Finally, a maintenance environment for database applications is described.

In this paper, a novel technique for the on-line processing of measurement outliers will be proposed. Both the computation speed and the accuracy of the technique presented will be compared with different classical approaches for handling outliers in measurement data (i.e. filtering techniques, outlier rejection techniques and robust regression techniques).

Our analysis makes use of an analytic formula for the irradiance in terms of spherical-harmonic coefficients of the illumination and shows, under appropriate assumptions, that the principal components or eigenvectors are identical to the spherical harmonic basis functions evaluated at the surface normal vectors. Our main contribution is in extending these results to the single-viewpoint case, showing how the principal eigenmodes and eigenvalues are affected when only a limited subset (the upper hemisphere) of normals is available and the spherical harmonics are no longer orthonormal over the restricted domain.

There are many existing methods for attribute extraction and construction, but constructing new attributes is still an art. These methods are very time consuming, and some of them need a priori knowledge of the data domain. They are not suitable for data mining dealing with large volumes of data.

Layer 2 is a fuzzy decision module that is used to decide which model in the first layer should be employed to make the final prediction. The output of the second layer is the output of the hybrid fuzzy model.

765,Simulating fermions on a quantum computer,"The real-time probabilistic simulation of quantum systems in classical computers is known to be limited by the so-called dynamical sign problem, a problem leading to exponential complexity. In 1981 Richard Feynman raised some provocative questions in connection to the ""exact imitation"" of such systems using a special device named a ""quantum computer"". Feynman hesitated about the possibility of imitating fermion systems using such a device. Here we address some of his concerns and, in particular, investigate the simulation of fermionic systems. We show how quantum computers avoid the sign problem in some cases by reducing the complexity from exponential to polynomial. Our demonstration is based upon the use of isomorphisms of algebras.

Two versions of a digital maintenance manual were developed, the difference between them being the number of design heuristics observed when designing navigational aids. Neither version was based on an analysis of the tasks carried out by users, nor were users involved in the design process. Instead, the manuals were developed directly from the digital information used to produce the existing paper manual. Usability trials were carried out to test both versions according to the time taken and errors committed by users during typical information retrieval tasks. Users were questioned to determine their ease of use (EOU) perceptions for each manual. The main outcomes were that the navigation aid used in the second version reduced the time taken to use the manual but increased the number of errors made by users. The navigational aid also seemed to reduce the perceived EOU compared with the first version. In both cases, the perceived EOU was lower than for a previous digital manual that had been developed using a task analysis and user input.

The constructive approach allows the direct computation of the paths of contact as the solution of a nonlinear equation system including the exact determination of the bounds of the paths of contact. The transmission error as well as curvature properties in the contact points are obtained in a convenient way. The resulting contact ellipses approximate the bearing area.

758,Four-terminal quantum resistor network for electron-wave computing,"Interconnected ultrathin conducting wires or, equivalently, interconnected quasi-one-dimensional electron waveguides, which form a quantum resistor network, are presented here in four-terminal configurations. The transmission behaviors through such four-terminal networks are evaluated and classified. In addition, we show that such networks can be used as the basic building blocks for a possible massive wave computing machine in the future. In a network, each interconnection, a node point, is an elastic scatterer that routes the electron wave. Routing and rerouting of electron waves in a network is described in the framework of quantum transport from Landauer-Buttiker theory in the presence of multiple elastic scatterers. Transmissions through various types of four-terminal generalized clean Aharonov-Bohm rings are investigated at zero temperature. Useful logic functions are gathered based on the transmission probability to each terminal with the use of the Buttiker symmetry rule. In the generalized rings, even and odd numbers of terminals can possess some distinctly different transmission characteristics as we have shown here and earlier. Just as an even or odd number of atoms in a ring is an important quantity for classifying the transmission behavior, we show here that whether the number of terminals is an even or an odd number is just as important in understanding the physics of transmission through such a ring. Furthermore, we show that there are three basic classes of four-terminal rings and the scaling relation for each class is provided. In particular, the existence of equitransmission among all four terminals is shown here. This particular physical phenomena cannot exist in any three-terminal ring. Comparisons and discussions of transmission characteristics between three-terminal and four-terminal rings are also presented. The node-equation approach by considering the Kirchhoff current conservation law at each node point is used for this analysis. Many useful logic functions for electron-wave computing are shown here. In particular, we show that a full adder can be constructed very simply using the equitransmission property of the four-terminal ring.

1348,Reconstructing surfaces by volumetric regularization using radial basis functions,"We present a new method of surface reconstruction that generates smooth and seamless models from sparse, noisy, nonuniform, and low resolution range data. Data acquisition techniques from computer vision, such as stereo range images and space carving, produce 3D point sets that are imprecise and nonuniform when compared to laser or optical range scanners. Traditional reconstruction algorithms designed for dense and precise data do not produce smooth reconstructions when applied to vision-based data sets. Our method constructs a 3D implicit surface, formulated as a sum of weighted radial basis functions. We achieve three primary advantages over existing algorithms: (1) the implicit functions we construct estimate the surface well in regions where there is little data, (2) the reconstructed surface is insensitive to noise in data acquisition because we can allow the surface to approximate, rather than exactly interpolate, the data, and (3) the reconstructed surface is locally detailed, yet globally smooth, because we use radial basis functions that achieve multiple orders of smoothness","['volumetric regularization', 'radial basis functions', 'surfaces reconstruction', 'low resolution range data', 'data acquisition techniques', 'computer vision', 'stereo range images', 'space carving', '3D point sets', 'vision-based data sets', '3D implicit surface', 'weighted radial basis functions', 'sparse range data', 'noisy data', 'nonuniform data']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'R', 'R']",

When calculating DVHs, the choice of voxel size is a compromise between computational speed (larger voxels) and accuracy (smaller voxels). We quantified the effect of voxel size on the accuracy of DVHs using an in-house computer program. The program was validated by comparison with a hand-calculated DVH for a single 0.4-U iodine-125 model 6711 seed. We used the program to find the voxel size required to obtain accurate DVHs of five iodine-125 prostate implant patients at our institution. One-millimeter cubes were sufficient to obtain DVHs that are accurate within 5% up to 200% of the prescription dose. For the five patient plans, we obtained good agreement with the VariSeed (version 6.7, Varian, USA) treatment planning software's DVH algorithm by using voxels with a sup-inf dimension equal to the spacing between successive transverse seed implant planes (5 mm). The volume that receives at least 200% of the target dose, V/sub 200/, calculated by VariSeed was 30% to 43% larger than that calculated by our program with small voxels.

993,A large deviations analysis of the transient of a queue with many Markov fluid inputs: approximations and fast simulation,"This article analyzes the transient buffer content distribution of a queue fed by a large number of Markov fluid sources. We characterize the probability of overflow at time t, given the current buffer level and the number of sources in the on-state. After scaling buffer and bandwidth resources by the number of sources n, we can apply large deviations techniques. The transient overflow probability decays exponentially in n. In the case of exponential on/off sources, we derive an expression for the decay rate of the rare event probability under consideration. For general Markov fluid sources, we present a plausible conjecture. We also provide the ""most likely path"" from the initial state to overflow (at time t). Knowledge of the decay rate and the most likely path to overflow leads to (i) approximations of the transient overflow probability and (ii) efficient simulation methods of the rare event of buffer overflow. The simulation methods, based on importance sampling, give a huge speed-up compared to straightforward simulations. The approximations are of low computational complexity and are accurate, as verified by means of simulation experiments","['large deviations analysis', 'Markov fluid inputs', 'approximations', 'transient buffer content distribution', 'bandwidth resources', 'transient overflow probability', 'simulation methods', 'importance sampling', 'computational complexity', 'buffer resources', 'ATM multiplexers', 'IP routers', 'queuing theory']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'U', 'U', 'U']",

This paper describes experiments that attempt to characterize the space that the adaptive compiler must search.

1255,Succession in standardization: grafting XML onto SGML,"Succession in standardization is often a problem. The advantages of improvements must be weighed against those of compatibility. If compatibility considerations dominate, a grafting process takes place. According to our taxonomy of succession, there are three types of outcomes. A Type I succession, where grafting is successful, entails compatibility between successors, technical paradigm compliance and continuity in the standards trajectory. In this paper, we examine issues of succession and focus on the Extensible Markup Language (XML). It was to be grafted on the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), a stable standard since 1988. However, XML was a profile, a subset and an extension of SGML (1988). Adaptation of SGML was needed (SGML 1999) to forge full (downward) compatibility with XML (1998). We describe the grafting efforts and analyze their outcomes. Our conclusion is that although SGML was a technical exemplar for XML developers, full compatibility was not achieved. The widespread use of HyperText Mark-up Language (HTML) exemplified the desirability of simplicity in XML, standardization. This and HTML's user market largely explain the discontinuity in SGML-XML succession","['standardization', 'XML', 'SGML', 'grafting process', 'Type I succession', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Standard Generalized Markup Language']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P']",

The purpose of this study was to develop evaluation techniques for such examinations using a hyperoxia challenge. Administration of pure oxygen was applied to test these techniques, as pure oxygen can be expected to induce relatively small signal intensity (SI) changes compared to CO/sub 2/-containing gases and thus requires very sensitive evaluation methods. Fourteen volunteers were investigated by alternating between breathing 100% O/sub 2/ and normal air, using two different paradigms of administration. Changes ranged from >30% in large veins to 1.71%+or-0.14% in basal ganglia and 0.82%+or-0.08% in white matter.

An objective method is presented that allows the adaptation of the significance threshold to the complexity of the paradigm used.

Therefore, a complementary DS chart that can be used to monitor the process variation caused by changes in process standard deviation should be developed. In this paper, the development of the DS s-charts for quickly detecting small shift in process standard deviation for agile manufacturing is presented. The construction of the DS s-charts is based on the same concepts in constructing the DS X-charts and is formulated as an optimization problem and solved with a genetic algorithm. The efficiency of the DS s-control chart is compared with that of the traditional s-control chart.

1446,The Tattletale technique,"Practical experience has taught many Java developers one thing: critical resources (mutexes, database connections, transactions, file handles, etc.) require timely and systematic release. Unfortunately, Java's garbage collector is not up to that job. According to the Java Language Specification, there are no guarantees when a garbage collector will run, when it will collect an object, or when it will finalize an object - if ever. Even more unfortunately, Java's counterpart to the C++ destructor (the finally block) is both tedious and error-prone, requiring developers to constantly remember and duplicate resource-releasing code. Consequently, even good Java developers can forget to release critical resources. There is a light at the end of the tunnel.

1233,Advanced optimization strategies in the Rice dHPF compiler,"High-Performance Fortran (HPF) was envisioned as a vehicle for modernizing legacy Fortran codes to achieve scalable parallel performance. To a large extent, today's commercially available HPF compilers have failed to deliver scalable parallel performance for a broad spectrum of applications because of insufficiently powerful compiler analysis and optimization. Substantial restructuring and hand-optimization can be required to achieve acceptable performance with an HPF port of an existing Fortran application, even for regular data-parallel applications. A key goal of the Rice dHPF compiler project has been to develop optimization techniques that enable a wide range of existing scientific applications to be ported easily to efficient HPF with minimal restructuring. This paper describes the challenges to effective parallelization presented by complex (but regular) data-parallel applications, and then describes how the novel analysis and optimization technologies in the dHPF compiler address these challenges effectively, without major rewriting of the applications. We illustrate the techniques by describing their use for parallelizing the NAS SP and BT benchmarks. The dHPF compiler generates multipartitioned parallelizations of these codes that are approaching the scalability and efficiency of sophisticated hand-coded parallelizations","['Rice dHPF compiler', 'HPF compilers', 'legacy Fortran codes', 'parallel performance', 'compiler analysis', 'multipartitioning', 'Mgh-Performance Fortran', 'compiler optimization', 'automatic parallelization']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'M', 'R', 'M']",
623,Stochastic recurrences of Jackpot Keno,"We describe a mathematical model and simulation study for Jackpot Keno, as implemented by Jupiters Network Gaming (JNG) in the Australian state of Queensland, and as controlled by the Queensland Office of Gaming Regulation (QOGR) (http://www.qogr.qld.gov.au/keno.shtml). The recurrences for the house net hold are derived and it is seen that these are piecewise linear with a ternary domain split, and further, the split points are stochastic in nature. Since this structure is intractable (Brockett and Levine, Statistics & Probability & their Applications, CBS College Publishing, 1984), estimation of house net hold obtained through an appropriately designed simulator using a random number generator with desirable properties is described. Since the model and simulation naturally derives hold given payscale, but JNG and QOGR require payscale given hold, an inverse problem was required to be solved. This required development of a special algorithm, which may be described as a stochastic binary search. Experimental results are presented, in which the simulator is used to determine jackpot pay-scales so as to satisfy legal requirements of approximately 75% of net revenue returned to the players, i.e., 25% net hold for the house (JNG). Details of the algorithm used to solve this problem are presented, and notwithstanding the stochastic nature of the simulation, convergence to a specified hold for the inverse problem has been achieved to within 0.1% in all cases of interest to date","['stochastic recurrences', 'Jackpot Keno', 'mathematical model', 'simulation', 'Jupiters Network Gaming', 'house net hold', 'piecewise linear', 'ternary domain split', 'probability', 'random number generator', 'inverse problem', 'stochastic binary search', 'experimental results', 'legal requirement', 'Chinese lottery game']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'M']",

The central composite design was employed to plan the experiments in order to achieve required information with reduced number of experiments. The process performance was evaluated. The ratio of minimum to maximum Feret's diameter was considered as circularity characteristic of the hole. The models of these three process characteristics were developed by linear multiple regression technique. The significant coefficients were obtained by performing analysis of variance (ANOVA) at 1, 5 and 7% levels of significance.

As compared with the methods already developed for the cylindrical cutter, this positioning enables the error between the cutter and the work-piece to be reduced.

We present a technique, fully operational and numerically simple, for establishing such bounds. Bounds are dynamic, i.e., they become stronger with the growing number of decisions explicitly identified. They are also parametric with respect to weighting coefficients.

1012,Evolving receptive-field controllers for mobile robots,"The use of evolutionary methods to generate controllers for real-world autonomous agents has attracted attention. Most of the pertinent research has employed genetic algorithms or variations thereof. Research has applied an alternative evolutionary method, evolution strategies, to the generation of simple Braitenberg vehicles. This application accelerates the development of such controllers by more than an order of magnitude (a few hours compared to more than two days). Motivated by this useful speedup, the paper investigates the evolution of more complex architectures, receptive-field controllers, that can employ nonlinear interactions and, therefore, can yield more complex behavior. It is interesting to note that the evolution strategy yields the same efficacy in terms of function evaluations, even though the second class of controllers requires up to 10 times more parameters than the simple Braitenberg architecture. In addition to the speedup, there is an important theoretical reason for preferring an evolution strategy over a genetic algorithm for this problem, namely the presence of epistasis","['receptive-field controllers', 'mobile robots', 'evolutionary methods', 'real-world autonomous agents', 'evolution strategies', 'simple Braitenberg vehicles', 'nonlinear interactions', 'complex behavior', 'radial basis functions', 'scalability']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'M', 'U']",
1057,Acceptance of a price discount: the role of the semantic relatedness between purchases and the comparative price format,"Two studies are reported where people are asked to accept or not a price reduction on a target product. In the high (low) relative saving version, the regular price of the target product is low (high). In both versions, the absolute value of the price reduction is the same as well as the total of regular prices of planned purchases. As first reported by Tversky and Kahneman (1981), findings show that the majority of people accept the price discount in the high-relative saving version whereas the minority do it in the low one. In Study 1, findings show that the previous preference reversal disappears when planned purchases are strongly related. Also, a previously unreported preference reversal is found. The majority of people accept the price discount when the products are weakly related whereas the minority accept when the products are strongly related. In Study 2, findings show that the classic preference reversal disappears as a function of the comparative price format. Also, another previously unreported preference reversal is found. When the offered price reduction relates to a low-priced product, people are more inclined to accept it with a control than a minimal comparative price format.

This low level of women's participation in computing courses occurs not only in Australia but also overseas.

874,"The curious ways of professional cultures and the ""two-body opportunity""","When two professionals are a couple, we sometimes refer to them as having a ""two-body problem."" However, when each partner of a couple exists in the same cultures, they also have an opportunity for deeply shared understanding and empathy, simply because each understands at a deep level the culture in which the other works. I explore this notion. A couple has what we call the ""two-body problem"" when both are professionals who are qualified for a kind of position that is relatively rare and who are very selective about the positions that they accept. For example, there are relatively scant numbers of jobs as a computer science professor-at any level. An individual considering an academic job may only be interested in research universities, or in teaching universities, restricting the choice of open positions substantially. The classic two-body ""problem"" arises when one partner wants to accept a new position that requires geographical relocation. Then, the other partner also needs to find a new position. Moreover, it can be very difficult to find a suitable position when they are naturally scarce","['professional cultures', 'two-body opportunity', 'computer science', 'academics']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P']",

The control is carried out, providing the given phase constraints varied in acceptable limits, in view of constraints on its value and incompleteness of the information about functioning disturbances. The approach is based on the introduction of auxiliary integral surfaces, on which the initial moving is projected. As a result the reduced equivalent moving is formed, being described by the scalar equation which in many important cases can be integrated directly. On the basis of the equation obtained solving a synthesis task is carried out and can be reduced to algebraic or integral inequalities.

1153,Direct aperture optimization: A turnkey solution for step-and-shoot IMRT,"IMRT treatment plans for step-and-shoot delivery have traditionally been produced through the optimization of intensity distributions (or maps) for each beam angle. The optimization step is followed by the application of a leaf-sequencing algorithm that translates each intensity map into a set of deliverable aperture shapes. In this article, we introduce an automated planning system in which we bypass the traditional intensity optimization, and instead directly optimize the shapes and the weights of the apertures. We call this approach ""direct aperture optimization."" This technique allows the user to specify the maximum number of apertures per beam direction, and hence provides significant control over the complexity of the treatment delivery. This is possible because the machine dependent delivery constraints imposed by the MLC are enforced within the aperture optimization algorithm rather than in a separate leaf-sequencing step. The leaf settings and the aperture intensities are optimized simultaneously using a simulated annealing algorithm. We have tested direct aperture optimization on a variety of patient cases using the EGS4/BEAM Monte Carlo package for our dose calculation engine. The results demonstrate that direct aperture optimization can produce highly conformal step-and-shoot treatment plans using only three to five apertures per beam direction. As compared with traditional optimization strategies, our studies demonstrate that direct aperture optimization can result in a significant reduction in both the number of beam segments and the number of monitor units. Direct aperture optimization therefore produces highly efficient treatment deliveries that maintain the full dosimetric benefits of IMRT","['direct aperture optimization', 'turnkey solution', 'step-and-shoot IMRT', 'IMRT treatment plans', 'intensity distributions', 'maps', 'beam angle', 'optimization step', 'leaf-sequencing algorithm', 'intensity map', 'deliverable aperture shapes', 'aperture shapes', 'automated planning system', 'machine dependent delivery constraints', 'MLC', 'aperture optimization algorithm', 'leaf settings', 'aperture intensities', 'simulated annealing algorithm', 'patient cases', 'EGS4/BEAM Monte Carlo package', 'dose calculation engine', 'highly conformal step-and-shoot treatment plans', 'beam segments', 'monitor units', 'highly efficient treatment deliveries', 'full dosimetric benefits', 'aperture weights', 'treatment delivery complexity']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'R']",

Conventional VR systems for the treatment of acrophobia have limitations, over-costly devices or somewhat unrealistic graphic scenes. The goal of this study was to develop an inexpensive and more realistic virtual environment (VE) in which to perform exposure therapy for acrophobia. It is based on a personal computer, and a virtual scene of a bunge-jump tower in the middle of a large city. The virtual scenario includes an open lift surrounded by props beside a tower, which allows the patient to feel a sense of heights. The effectiveness of the VE was evaluated through the clinical treatment of a subject who was suffering from the fear of heights. As a result, it was proved that this VR environment was effective and realistic at overcoming acrophobia according not only to the comparison results of a variety of questionnaires before and after treatment but also to the subject's comments that the VE seemed to evoke more fearful feelings than the real situation","['therapeutic case', 'realistic virtual environment', 'exposure therapy', 'personal computer', 'virtual scene', 'clinical treatment', 'virtual reality therapy system', 'acrophobia treatment', 'patient anxiety', 'patient treatment', 'psychotherapy', 'heights phobia']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'U', 'M']",

The recurrent neural network (RNN) type is used for such a purpose. Contrary to the programmable controller, an RNN-based sequential controller is based on a definite mathematical model rather than depending on the experience and trial and error techniques. The proposed controller is also more flexible because it is not limited by the restrictions of the finite state automata theory. Adequate guidelines of how to construct an RNN-based sequential controller are presented. These guidelines are applied to different case studies. The proposed controller is tested by simulations and real-time experiments. These tests prove the successfulness of the proposed controller performances.

The resulting cooperative system called SIGIU is composed of a set of integrated operating systems (SYDEX) and the global planning and coordination system (SYGEC). The objective is to integrate the set of SYDEX and the SYGEC into a single coherent system for all the SIGIU's users according to their tasks, their roles, and their responsibilities within the municipal administration.

With the development of GIS and facilities management (FM) applications, SVEC decided this should be the basis for an information system that would model its physical plant and interface with its accounting and billing systems. It could add applications such as outage management, staking, line design and metering to use this information and interface with these databases. However, based on SVEC's size it was not feasible to implement a sophisticated and expensive GIS/FM system. Over the past nine years, SVEC has had success with a building block approach, and its customers and employees are realizing the benefits of the automated applications.

78,Applying genetic algorithms to solve the fuzzy optimal profit problem,"This study investigated the application of genetic algorithms in solving a fuzzy optimization problem that arises in business and economics. In this problem, a fuzzy price is determined using a linear or a quadratic fuzzy demand function as well as a linear cost function. The objective is to find the optimal fuzzy profit, which is derived from the fuzzy price and fuzzy cost. Traditional methods for solving this problem are (1) the extension principle, and (2) using interval arithmetic and alpha -cuts. However, we argue that traditional methods for solving this problem are too restrictive to produce an optimal solution, and that an alternative approach is possibly needed. We use genetic algorithms to obtain an approximate solution for this fuzzy optimal profit problem without using membership functions. We not only give empirical examples to show the effectiveness of this approach, but also give theoretical proofs to validate correctness of the algorithm. We conclude that genetic algorithms can produce good approximate solutions when applied to solve fuzzy optimization problems","['genetic algorithms', 'fuzzy optimal profit problem', 'fuzzy optimization problem', 'business', 'economics', 'fuzzy price', 'quadratic fuzzy demand function', 'linear cost function', 'approximate solution', 'theoretical proofs', 'linear fuzzy demand function', 'algorithm correctness validation']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'R']",

1151,A method for geometrical verification of dynamic intensity modulated radiotherapy using a scanning electronic portal imaging device,"In order to guarantee the safe delivery of dynamic intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), verification of the leaf trajectories during the treatment is necessary. Our aim in this study is to develop a method for on-line verification of leaf trajectories using an electronic portal imaging device with scanning read-out, independent of the multileaf collimator. Examples of such scanning imagers are electronic portal imaging devices (EPIDs) based on liquid-filled ionization chambers and those based on amorphous silicon. Portal images were acquired continuously with a liquid-filled ionization chamber EPID during the delivery, together with the signal of treatment progress that is generated by the accelerator. For each portal image, the prescribed leaf and diaphragm positions were computed from the dynamic prescription and the progress information. Motion distortion effects of the leaves are corrected based on the treatment progress that is recorded for each image row. The aperture formed by the prescribed leaves and diaphragms is used as the reference field edge, while the actual field edge is found using a maximum-gradient edge detector. The errors in leaf and diaphragm position are found from the deviations between the reference field edge and the detected field edge. Earlier measurements of the dynamic EPID response show that the accuracy of the detected field edge is better than 1 mm. To ensure that the verification is independent of inaccuracies in the acquired progress signal, the signal was checked with diode measurements beforehand. The method was tested on three different dynamic prescriptions. Using the described method, we correctly reproduced the distorted field edges. Verifying a single portal image took 0.1 s on an 866 MHz personal computer. Two flaws in the control system of our experimental dynamic multileaf collimator were correctly revealed with our method. First, the errors in leaf position increase with leaf speed, indicating a delay of approximately 0.8 s in the control system. Second, the accuracy of the leaves and diaphragms depends on the direction of motion.

Patients were administered a battery of outcome measures assessing eating disorders symptomathology, attitudes toward food, body dissatisfaction, level of anxiety, motivation for change, level of assertiveness, and general psychiatric symptoms. In the short term, the VR treatment was more effective than the traditional cognitive-behavioral psychonutritional groups in improving the overall psychological state of the patients. In particular, the therapy was more effective in improving body satisfaction, self-efficacy, and motivation for change. No significant differences were found in the reduction of the binge eating behavior. The possibility of inducing a significant change in body image and its associated behaviors using a VR-based short-term therapy can be useful to improve the body satisfaction in traditional weight reduction programs. However, given the nature of this research that does not include a followup study, the obtained results are preliminary only","['multidimensional therapy', 'body image disturbances', 'binge eating disorders', 'residential weight control treatment', 'psychonutritional groups', 'cognitive-behavior approach', 'anxiety', 'psychiatric symptoms', 'virtual reality', 'obesity', 'patient therapy']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'U', 'U', 'R']",
996,Flexible air-jet tooling for vibratory bowl feeder systems,"Vibratory bowl feeders (VBFs) are machines that feed various small parts in large volume automatic assembly systems. Their shortcomings, like inflexibility and the propensity to jam, stem from the use of mechanical orienting devices. Air jet based orienting devices can be implemented to overcome these limitations. Applications of passive and active air jet based orienting devices that replace conventional devices for the VBF are discussed. Passive devices, which reject incorrectly oriented parts, are discussed first. Active air jet based orienting devices are then introduced to further improve the flexibility of VBFs. Since active devices reorient parts into a desired orientation, the part motion under their influence is analyzed.

539,Perfusion quantification using Gaussian process deconvolution,"The quantification of perfusion using dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI (DSC-MRI) requires deconvolution to obtain the residual impulse response function (IRF). In this work, a method using the Gaussian process for deconvolution (GPD) is proposed. The fact that the IRF is smooth is incorporated as a constraint in the method. The GPD method, which automatically estimates the noise level in each voxel, has the advantage that model parameters are optimized automatically. The GPD is compared to singular value decomposition (SVD) using a common threshold for the singular values, and to SVD using a threshold optimized according to the noise level in each voxel. The comparison is carried out using artificial data as well as data from healthy volunteers. It is shown that GPD is comparable to SVD with a variable optimized threshold when determining the maximum of the IRF, which is directly related to the perfusion. GPD provides a better estimate of the entire IRF. As the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increases or the time resolution of the measurements increases, GPD is shown to be superior to SVD. This is also found for large distribution volumes","['perfusion quantification', 'Gaussian process deconvolution', 'dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI', 'residual impulse response function', 'noise level', 'singular value decomposition', 'optimized model parameters', 'capillary blood flow', 'mean transit time', 'optimized joint Gaussian distribution', 'correlation length', 'likelihood function']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'U', 'M', 'M', 'U', 'M']",

We show that our scheme incurs constant processing, message, and storage overhead for a rekey operation when a single member joins or leaves the group, and logarithmic overhead for bulk simultaneous changes to the group membership. These bounds hold even when group dynamics are not known a priori. Our rekeying algorithm requires a particular clustering of the members of the secure multicast group. We describe a protocol to achieve such clustering and show that it is feasible to efficiently cluster members over realistic Internet-like topologies. We evaluate the overhead of our own rekeying scheme and also of previously published schemes via simulation over an Internet topology map containing over 280 000 routers.

913,Control of a coupled map lattice model for vortex shedding in the wake of a cylinder,"The flow behind a vibrating flexible cable at low Reynolds numbers can exhibit complex wake structures such as lace-like patterns, vortex dislocations and frequency cells. These structures have been observed in experiments and numerical simulations, and are predicted by a previously developed low-order coupled map lattice (CML). The discrete (in time and space) CML models consist of a series of diffusively coupled circle map oscillators along the cable span. Motivated by a desire to modify the complex wake patterns behind flexible vibrating cables, we have studied the addition of control terms into the highly efficient CML models and explored the resulting dynamics. Proportional, adaptive proportional and discontinuous non-linear (DNL) control methods were used to derive the control laws. The first method employed occasional proportional feedback. The adaptive method used spatio-temporal feedback control. The DNL method used a discontinuous feedback linearization procedure, and the controller was designed for the resulting linearized system using eigenvalue assignment. These techniques were applied to a modeled vortex dislocation structure in the wake of a vibrating cable in uniform freestream flow. Parallel shedding patterns were achieved for a range of forcing frequency-forcing amplitude combinations studied to validate the control theory. The adaptive proportional and DNL methods were found to be more effective than the proportional control method due to the incorporation of a spatially varying feedback gain across the cylinder span. The DNL method was found to be the most efficient controller of the low-order CML model. The required control level across the cable span was correlated to the 1/1 lock-on behavior of the temporal circle map","['coupled map lattice', 'vortex shedding', 'wake', 'cylinder', 'vibrating flexible cable', 'low Reynolds numbers', 'vortex dislocation', 'vortex dislocation', 'coupled circle map oscillators', 'proportional feedback', 'spatio-temporal feedback control', '1/1 lock-on', 'temporal circle map', 'discontinuous nonlinear control', 'vortex dislocations']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'M', 'P']",

A benefit of source separation is that it overcomes the conventional cross-talk or leakage problem of adaptive beamforming. Beamforming on the other hand exploits geometric information which is often readily available but not utilized in blind algorithms. We propose to join these benefits by combining cross-power minimization of second-order source separation with geometric linear constraints used in adaptive beamforming.

The control system employs a preload relay (P_Relay) in series with a PID controller. The P_Relay ensures a high gain to yield a robust performance. However, it also incurs a chattering phenomenon. In this paper, instead of viewing the chattering as an undesirable yet inevitable feature, we use it as a naturally occurring signal for tuning and re-tuning the PID controller as the operating regime digresses. No other explicit input signal is required. Once the PID controller is tuned for a particular operating point, the relay may be disabled and chattering ceases correspondingly. However, it is invoked when there is a change in setpoint to another operating regime. In this way, the approach is also applicable to time-varying systems as the PID tuning can be continuous, based on the latest set of chattering characteristics.

Instead, it is commonly observed that people match their response probabilities to the payoff probabilities. We report three experiments on this choice anomaly using a simple probability learning task in which participants were provided with (i) large financial incentives, (ii) meaningful and regular feedback, and (iii) extensive training. In each experiment large proportions of participants adopted the optimal response strategy and all three of the factors mentioned above contributed to this. The results are supportive of rational choice theory","['probability matching', 'rationality', 'probability learning task', 'payoff probability', 'rational choice theory', 'response probabilities', 'choice anomaly', 'large financial incentives', 'feedback', 'extensive training', 'optimal response strategy', 'meaningful regular feedback']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R']",

It provides a maximum of 8.3-MW mechanical power with a rated motor voltage of 3 kV.

The basic idea is that of defining the numerical method as the combination (blending) of two suitable component methods. By carefully choosing such methods, it is shown that very efficient implementations can be obtained. Moreover, some of them, characterized by a diagonal splitting, are well suited for parallel computers.

Optimal scheduling of AGVs can significantly help to increase the efficiency of the manufacturing process by minimizing the idle time of MCs waiting for the raw materials. We analyse the requirements for an optimal schedule and then provide a mathematical framework for an efficient schedule of material delivery by an AGV. A mathematical model is developed and then a strategy for optimal material distribution of the available raw material to the MCs is derived. With this model, the optimal number of MCs to be utilized is also determined. Finally, the material delivery schedule employing multiple journeys to the MCs by the AGV is carried out. Through rigorous analysis and simulation experiments, we show that such a delivery strategy will optimize the overall performance","['optimal material distribution policies', 'flexible manufacturing systems', 'AGV', 'automated guided vehicle', 'material handling', 'machine centres', 'optimal scheduling', 'material delivery', 'waiting time', 'manufacturing lead time', 'idle time minimization']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'M', 'R']",
1095,Development of a real-time monitoring system,"This paper describes a pattern recognition (PR) technique, which uses learning vector quantization (LVQ). This method is adapted for practical application to solve problems in the area of condition monitoring and fault diagnosis where a number of fault signatures are involved. In these situations, the aim is health monitoring, including identification of deterioration of the healthy condition and identification of causes of the failure in real-time. For this reason a fault database is developed which contains the collected information about various states of operation of the system in the form of pattern vectors. The task of the real-time monitoring system is to correlate patterns of unknown faults with the known fault signatures in the fault database. This will determine cause of failure and degree of deterioration of the system under test. The problem of fault diagnosis may involve a large number of patterns and large sampling time, which affects the learning stage of neural networks. The study here also aims to find a fast learning model of neural networks for instances when a high number of patterns and numerous processing elements are involved. It begins searching for an appropriate solution. The study is extended to the enforcement learning models and considers LVQ as a network emerged from the competitive learning model through enforcement training.

Rather, they create new sentences that are grammatical, that cohere with one another, and that capture the most salient pieces of information in the original document. Given that large collections of text/abstract pairs are available online, it is now possible to envision algorithms that are trained to mimic this process. In this paper, we focus on sentence compression, a simpler version of this larger challenge. We aim to achieve two goals simultaneously: our compressions should be grammatical, and they should retain the most important pieces of information. These two goals can conflict. We devise both a noisy-channel and a decision-tree approach to the problem, and we evaluate results against manual compressions and a simple baseline","['sentence compression', 'grammatical', 'noisy-channel', 'decision-tree', 'document summarization']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R']",
779,Domesticating computers and the Internet,"The people who use computers and the ways they use them have changed substantially over the past 25 years. In the beginning highly educated people, mostly men, in technical professions used computers for work, but over time a much broader range of people are using computers for personal and domestic purposes. This trend is still continuing, and over a shorter time scale has been replicated with the use of the Internet. The paper uses data from four national surveys to document how personal computers and the Internet have become increasingly domesticated since 1995 and to explore the mechanisms for this shift. Now people log on more often from home than from places of employment and do so for pleasure and for personal purposes rather than for their jobs. Analyses comparing veteran Internet users to novices in 1998 and 2000 and analyses comparing the change in use within a single sample between 1995 and 1996 support two complementary explanations for how these technologies have become domesticated. Women, children, and less well-educated individuals are increasingly using computers and the Internet and have a more personal set of motives than well-educated men. In addition, the widespread diffusion of the PC and the Internet and the response of the computing industry to the diversity in consumers has led to a rich set of personal and domestic services","['Internet', 'highly educated people', 'technical professions', 'domestic purposes', 'national surveys', 'personal computers', 'veteran Internet users', 'novices', 'women', 'children', 'computing industry', 'domestic services', 'computer domestication', 'personal usage', 'personal motives', 'PC diffusion', 'demographics', 'online behavior']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'M', 'R', 'R', 'U', 'U']",

To absorb energy stored in line stray inductance, a regenerative DC snubber can be utilized which has only one capacitor without discharging resistors or complicated regenerative circuit for snubber energy.

The shear energy created in the primary zone, the friction energy produced at the rake face-chip contact zone and the heat balance between the moving chip and stationary tool are considered. The temperature distribution is solved using the finite difference method. Later, the model is extended to milling where the cutting is interrupted and the chip thickness varies with time.

For the feasibility problem, Farkas' lemma provides a characterization for general undirected graphs, asserting roughly that there exists such a flow if and only if the so-called distance inequality holds for every choice of distance functions arising from nonnegative node weights. For rings, this (straightforward) result will be improved in two ways. We prove that, independent of the integrality of node capacities, it suffices to require the distance inequality only for distances arising from (0-1-2)-valued node weights, a requirement that will be called the double-cut condition. Moreover, for integer-valued node capacities, the double-cut condition implies the existence of a half-integral multicommodity flow. In this case there is even an integer-valued multicommodity flow that violates each node capacity by at most one. Our approach gives rise to a combinatorial, strongly polynomial algorithm to compute either a violating double-cut or a node-capacitated multicommodity flow.

Advantages of computer aided optimization include high design turnaround time, flexibility to explore a larger design space and the development and adaptation of automation techniques for design and optimization. A CVD reactor consisting of a vertical impinging jet at atmospheric pressure, for growing titanium nitride films, is studied for thin film deposition. Numerical modeling and simulation are used to determine the rate of deposition and film uniformity over a wide range of design variables and operating conditions.

The optimization procedure employs an objective function characterizing film quality, productivity and operational costs based on reactor gas flow rate, susceptor temperature and precursor concentration.

1231,Efficient parallel programming on scalable shared memory systems with High Performance Fortran,"OpenMP offers a high-level interface for parallel programming on scalable shared memory (SMP) architectures. It provides the user with simple work-sharing directives while it relies on the compiler to generate parallel programs based on thread parallelism. However, the lack of language features for exploiting data locality often results in poor performance since the non-uniform memory access times on scalable SMP machines cannot be neglected. High Performance Fortran (HPF), the de-facto standard for data parallel programming, offers a rich set of data distribution directives in order to exploit data locality, but it has been mainly targeted towards distributed memory machines. In this paper we describe an optimized execution model for HPF programs on SMP machines that avails itself with mechanisms provided by OpenMP for work sharing and thread parallelism, while exploiting data locality based on user-specified distribution directives. Data locality does not only ensure that most memory accesses are close to the executing threads and are therefore faster, but it also minimizes synchronization overheads, especially in the case of unstructured reductions. The proposed shared memory execution model for HPF relies on a small set of language extensions, which resemble the OpenMP work-sharing features. These extensions, together with an optimized shared memory parallelization and execution model, have been implemented in the ADAPTOR HPF compilation system and experimental results verify the efficiency of the chosen approach","['parallel programming', 'scalable shared memory', 'High Performance Fortran', 'multiprocessor architectures', 'scalable hardware', 'shared memory multiprocessor']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'M', 'M', 'M']",

An image processing program was developed to enhance and segment the flow image, and then to identify the particles. Over 90% of all the particles can be identified and located from the partially overlapped particle images using the circular Hough transform. Then the 3D position of each detected particle was determined by matching its front view image to its side view image. The particle velocity was then obtained by pairing its images in successive video fields. The measurements for the spherical expanded polystyrene particle-oil flows show that the particles, like the spherical bubbles in laminar bubbly flows, tend to conglomerate near the pipe wall and to line up to form the particle clusters.

This is an additional dimension of the generalized mosaic paradigm, which has demonstrated yielding high radiometric dynamic range images in a wide field of view, using a spatially varying density filter. The resulting mosaic represents the spectrum at each scene point. The image acquisition is as easy as in traditional image mosaics. We derive an efficient scene sampling rate, and use a registration method that accommodates the spatially varying properties of the filter. Using the data acquired by this method, we demonstrate scene rendering under different simulated illumination spectra. We are also able to infer information about the scene illumination.

1014,"Modelling of complete robot dynamics based on a multi-dimensional, RBF-like neural architecture","A neural network based identification approach of manipulator dynamics is presented. For a structured modelling, RBF-like static neural networks are used in order to represent and adapt all model parameters with their non-linear dependences on the joint positions. The neural architecture is hierarchically organised to reach optimal adjustment to structural a priori-knowledge about the identification problem.

1051,Faking it: simulating dependent types in Haskell,"Dependent types reflect the fact that validity of data is often a relative notion by allowing prior data to affect the types of subsequent data. Not only does this make for a precise type system, but also a highly generic one: both the type and the program for each instance of a family of operations can be computed from the data which codes for that instance. Recent experimental extensions to the Haskell type class mechanism give us strong tools to relativize types to other types. We may simulate some aspects of dependent typing by making counterfeit type-level copies of data, with type constructors simulating data constructors and type classes simulating datatypes.

933,Real-time estimations of multi-modal frequencies for smart structures,"In this paper, various methods for the real-time estimation of multi-modal frequencies are realized in real time and compared through numerical and experimental tests. These parameter-based frequency estimation methods can be applied to various engineering fields such as communications, radar and adaptive vibration and noise control. Well-known frequency estimation methods are introduced and explained. The Bairstow method is introduced to find the roots of a characteristic equation for estimations of multi-modal frequencies, and the computational efficiency of the Bairstow method is shown quantitatively. For a simple numerical test, we consider two sinusoids of the same amplitudes mixed with various amounts of white noise. The test results show that the auto regressive (AR) and auto regressive and moving average (ARMA) methods are unsuitable in noisy environments. The other methods apart from the AR method have fast tracking capability. From the point of view of computational efficiency, the results reveal that the ARMA method is inefficient, while the cascade notch filter method is very effective. The linearized adaptive notch filter and recursive maximum likelihood methods have average performances. Experimental tests are devised to confirm the feasibility of real-time computations and to impose the severe conditions of drastically different amplitudes and of considerable changes of natural frequencies. We have performed experiments to extract the natural frequencies from the vibration signal of wing-like composite plates in real time. The natural frequencies of the specimen are changed by added masses. Especially, the AR method exhibits a remarkable performance in spite of the severe conditions.

An important aspect of portable performance is the behavior of the available HPF compilers. Ideally, a programmer may expect comparable performance between different HPF compilers, given the same program and the same machine. To test the performance portability between compilers, we have designed a special benchmark suite, called the TNO HPF benchmark suite. It consists of a set of HPF programs that test various aspects of efficient parallel code generation. The benchmark suite consists of a number of template programs that are used to generate test programs with different array sizes, alignments, distributions, and iteration spaces. It ranges from very simple assignments to more complex assignments such as triangular iteration spaces, convex iteration spaces, coupled subscripts, and indirection arrays. We have run the TNO HPF benchmark suite on three compilers: the PREPARE prototype compiler, the PGI-HPF compiler, and the GMD Adaptor HPF compiler. Results show performance differences that can be quite large (up to two orders of magnitude for the same test program). Closer inspection reveals that the origin of most of the differences in performance is due to differences in local enumeration and storage of distributed array elements","['benchmark suite', 'High-Performance Fortran', 'portable performance', 'distributed memory machines', 'HPF compilers', 'performance portability', 'parallel compilers', 'compiler optimizations']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'M']",

780,Failures and successes: notes on the development of electronic cash,"Between 1997 and 2001, two mid-sized communities in Canada hosted North America's most comprehensive experiment to introduce electronic cash and, in the process, replace physical cash for casual, low-value payments. The technology used was Mondex, and its implementation was supported by all the country's major banks. It was launched with an extensive publicity campaign to promote Mondex not only in the domestic but also in the global market, for which the Canadian implementation was to serve as a ""showcase."" However, soon after the start of the first field test it became apparent that the new technology did not work smoothly. On the contrary, it created a host of controversies, in areas as varied as computer security, consumer privacy, and monetary policy. In the following years, few of these controversies could be resolved and Mondex could not be established as a widely used payment mechanism. In 2001, the experiment was finally terminated. Using the concepts developed in recent science and technology studies (STS), the article analyzes these controversies as resulting from the difficulties of fitting electronic cash, a new sociotechnical system, into the complex setting of the existing payment system. The story of Mondex not only offers lessons on why technologies fail, but also offers insight into how short-term failures can contribute to long-term transformations. This suggests the need to rethink the dichotomy of success and failure","['electronic cash', 'Canada', 'low-value payments', 'Mondex', 'major banks', 'publicity campaign', 'global market', 'Canadian implementation', 'computer security', 'consumer privacy', 'monetary policy', 'payment mechanism', 'science and technology studies', 'sociotechnical system', 'short-term failures', 'long-term transformations']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P']",

Therefore, improving the replication quality of land-groove or pit structure and reducing the birefringence distribution are emerging as important criteria in the fabrication of high-density optical disk substrates. We control the transcribability and distribution of birefringence by inserting an insulation layer under the stamper during injection-compression molding of DVD RAM substrates. The effects of the insulation layer on the geometrical and optical properties, such as transcribability and birefringence distribution, are examined experimentally.

Against the background described, a fairly detailed mathematical model of a contemporary car-trailer system is constructed and a baseline set of parameter values is given. In reduced form, the model is shown to give results in accordance with literature. The properties of the baseline combination are explored using both linear and non-linear versions of the model. The influences of damping at the pintle joint and of several other design parameters on the stability of the linear system in the neighbourhood of the critical snaking speed are calculated and discussed. Coulomb friction damping at the pintle pin is then included and simulations are used to indicate the consequent amplitude-dependent behaviour. The friction damping, especially when its level has to be chosen by the user, is shown to give dangerous characteristics, despite having some capacity for stabilization of the snaking motions. It is concluded that pintle pin friction damping does not represent a satisfactory solution to the snaking problem.

1155,A leaf sequencing algorithm to enlarge treatment field length in IMRT,"With MLC-based IMRT, the maximum usable field size is often smaller than the maximum field size for conventional treatments. This is due to the constraints of the overtravel distances of MLC leaves and/or jaws. Using a new leaf sequencing algorithm, the usable IMRT field length (perpendicular to the MLC motion) can be mostly made equal to the full length of the MLC field without violating the upper jaw overtravel limit. For any given intensity pattern, a criterion was proposed to assess whether an intensity pattern can be delivered without violation of the jaw position constraints. If the criterion is met, the new algorithm will consider the jaw position constraints during the segmentation for the step and shoot delivery method. The strategy employed by the algorithm is to connect the intensity elements outside the jaw overtravel limits with those inside the jaw overtravel limits. Several methods were used to establish these connections during segmentation by modifying a previously published algorithm (areal algorithm), including changing the intensity level, alternating the leaf-sequencing direction, or limiting the segment field size. The algorithm was tested with 1000 random intensity patterns with dimensions of 21*27 cm/sup 2/, 800 intensity patterns with higher intensity outside the jaw overtravel limit, and three different types of clinical treatment plans that were undeliverable using a segmentation method from a commercial treatment planning system. The new algorithm achieved a success rate of 100% with these test patterns. For the 1000 random patterns, the new algorithm yields a similar average number of segments of 36.9+or-2.9 in comparison to 36.6+or-1.3 when using the areal algorithm. For the 800 patterns with higher intensities outside the jaw overtravel limits, the new algorithm results in an increase of 25% in the average number of segments compared to the areal algorithm. However, the areal algorithm fails to create deliverable segments for 90% of these patterns.

545,Interaction and presence in the clinical relationship: virtual reality (VR) as communicative medium between patient and therapist,"The great potential offered by virtual reality (VR) to clinical psychologists derives prevalently from the central role, in psychotherapy, occupied by the imagination and by memory. These two elements, which are fundamental in our life, present absolute and relative limits to the individual potential. Using VR as an advanced imaginal system, an experience that is able to reduce the gap existing between imagination and reality, it is possible to transcend these limits. In this sense, VR can improve the efficacy of a psychological therapy for its capability of reducing the distinction between the computer's reality and the conventional reality. Two are the core characteristics of this synthetic imaginal experience: the perceptual illusion of nonmediation and the possibility of building and sharing a common ground. In this sense, experiencing presence in a clinical virtual environment (VE), such as a shared virtual hospital, requires more than reproduction of the physical features of external reality.

Each iteration of the randomized algorithm for the ASN involves the following two phases: (1) generation of random cuts using a multidimensional Ber(p) distribution and calculation of the associated cut lengths (objective functions) and some related quantities, such as rare-event probabilities; (2) updating the parameter vector p on the basis of the data collected in the first phase. We show that the Ber(p) distribution converges in distribution to a degenerated one, Ber(p/sub d/*), p/sub d/* = (p/sub d/,/sub 1/, p/sub d,n/) in the sense that some elements of p/sub d/*, will be unities and the rest zeros. The unity elements of p/sub d/* uniquely define a cut which will be taken as the estimate of the maximal cut. A similar approach is used for the partition problem. Supporting numerical results are given as well. Our numerical studies suggest that for the maximal cut and partition problems the proposed algorithm typically has polynomial complexity in the size of the network","['partition problems', 'randomized algorithm', 'maximal cut problems', 'Bernoulli distribution', 'deterministic network', 'associated stochastic network', 'random cuts', 'probability', 'numerical results', 'polynomial complexity', 'cross entropy method', 'rare event simulation', 'combinatorial optimization', 'importance sampling']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'M', 'M', 'U', 'U']",
83,A distributed mobile agent framework for maintaining persistent distance education,"Mobile agent techniques involve distributed control if communication is required among different types of agents, especially when mobile agents can migrate from station to station. This technique can be implemented in a distributed distance learning environment, which allows students or instructors to login from anywhere to a central server in an education center while still retaining the look-and-feel of personal setups. In this research paper, we propose a distributed agent framework along with its communication messages to facilitate mobile personal agents, which serve three different groups of distance education users: instructors, students, and system administrators. We propose an agent communication framework as well as agent evolution states of mobile agents. The communication architecture and message transmission protocols are illustrated. The system is implemented on the Windows platform to support nomadic accessibility of remote distance learning users. Personal data also migrate with the mobile agents, allowing users to maintain accessibility to some extent even when the Internet connection is temperately disconnected. Using user-friendly personal agents, a distance education platform can include different tools to meet different needs for users","['distributed mobile agent framework', 'persistent distance education', 'distributed control', 'central server', 'distributed agent framework', 'message transmission protocols', 'user-friendly personal agents']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P']",
1254,Supporting unified interface to wrapper generator in integrated information retrieval,"Given the ever-increasing scale and diversity of information and applications on the Internet, improving the technology of information retrieval is an urgent research objective. Retrieved information is either semi-structured or unstructured in format and its sources are extremely heterogeneous. In consequence, the task of efficiently gathering and extracting information from documents can be both difficult and tedious. Given this variety of sources and formats, many choose to use mediator/wrapper architecture, but its use demands a fast means of generating efficient wrappers. In this paper, we present a design for an automatic eXtensible Markup Language (XML)-based framework with which to generate wrappers rapidly. Wrappers created with this framework support a unified interface for a meta-search information retrieval system based on the Internet Search Service using the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) standard. Greatly advantaged by the compatibility of CORBA and XML, a user can quickly and easily develop information-gathering applications, such as a meta-search engine or any other information source retrieval method. The two main things our design provides are a method of wrapper generation that is fast, simple, and efficient, and a wrapper generator that is CORBA and XML-compliant and that supports a unified interface","['unified interface', 'wrapper generator', 'integrated information retrieval', 'Internet', 'automatic eXtensible Markup Language', 'CORBA', 'meta-search engine']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P']",
1211,Hybrid decision tree,"In this paper, a hybrid learning approach named hybrid decision tree (HDT) is proposed. HDT simulates human reasoning by using symbolic learning to do qualitative analysis and using neural learning to do subsequent quantitative analysis. It generates the trunk of a binary HDT according to the binary information gain ratio criterion in an instance space defined by only original unordered attributes. If unordered attributes cannot further distinguish training examples falling into a leaf node whose diversity is beyond the diversity-threshold, then the node is marked as a dummy node. After all those dummy nodes are marked, a specific feedforward neural network named FANNC that is trained in an instance space defined by only original ordered attributes is exploited to accomplish the learning task. Moreover, this paper distinguishes three kinds of incremental learning tasks. Two incremental learning procedures designed for example-incremental learning with different storage requirements are provided, which enables HDT to deal gracefully with data sets where new data are frequently appended. Also a hypothesis-driven constructive induction mechanism is provided, which enables HDT to generate compact concept descriptions","['hybrid decision tree', 'hybrid learning approach', 'reasoning', 'symbolic learning', 'qualitative analysis', 'neural learning', 'quantitative analysis', 'binary information gain ratio criterion', 'feedforward neural network', 'FANNC', 'incremental learning', 'storage requirements', 'data sets', 'hypothesis-driven constructive induction']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P']",
644,Three-dimensional spiral MR imaging: application to renal multiphase contrast-enhanced angiography,"A fast MR pulse sequence with spiral in-plane readout and conventional 3D partition encoding was developed for multiphase contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) of the renal vasculature. Compared to a standard multiphase 3D CE-MRA with FLASH readout, an isotropic in-plane spatial resolution of 1.4*1.4 mm/sup 2/ over 2.0*1.4 mm/sup 2/ could be achieved with a temporal resolution of 6 sec. The theoretical gain of spatial resolution by using the spiral pulse sequence and the performance in the presence of turbulent flow was evaluated in phantom measurements. Multiphase 3D CE-MRA of the renal arteries was performed in five healthy volunteers using both techniques. A deblurring technique was used to correct the spiral raw data. Thereby, the off-resonance frequencies were determined by minimizing the imaginary part of the data in image space. The chosen correction algorithm was able to reduce image blurring substantially in all MRA phases. The image quality of the spiral CE-MRA pulse sequence was comparable to that of the FLASH CE-MRA with increased spatial resolution and a 25% reduced contrast-to-noise ratio. Additionally, artifacts specific to spiral MRI could be observed which had no impact on the assessment of the renal arteries","['renal multiphase contrast-enhanced angiography', 'spiral in-plane readout', '3D partition encoding', 'renal vasculature', 'spatial resolution', 'deblurring', 'off-resonance frequencies', 'image quality', 'reduced contrast-to-noise ratio', '3D spiral MRI', 'flow artifacts', 'fast pulse sequence', 'image reconstruction', 'FLASH sequence']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'M', 'R']",

Given only samples of a finite-dimensional differentiable manifold and no a priori knowledge of the manifold's geometry or topology except for its dimension, the goal is to find a description of the manifold. The learned manifold must approximate the true manifold well, both geometrically and topologically, when the sampling density is sufficiently high. The proposed algorithm constructs a simplicial complex based on approximations to the tangent bundle of the manifold. An important property of the algorithm is that its complexity depends on the dimension of the manifold, rather than that of the embedding space. Successful examples are presented in the cases of learning curves in the plane, curves in space, and surfaces in space; in addition, a case when the algorithm fails is analyzed","['simplicial reconstructions', 'manifold learning', 'finite-dimensional differentiable manifold', 'learned manifold', 'true manifold', 'sampling density', 'simplicial complex']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P']",

1030,Comparison of automated digital elevation model extraction results using along-track ASTER and across-track SPOT stereo images,"A digital elevation model (DEM) can be extracted automatically from stereo satellite images. During the past decade, the most common satellite data used to extract DEM was the across-track SPOT. Recently, the addition of along-track ASTER data, which can be downloaded freely, provides another attractive alternative to extract DEM data. This work compares the automated DEM extraction results using an ASTER stereo pair and a SPOT stereo pair over an area of hilly mountains in Drum Mountain, Utah, when compared to a USGS 7.5-min DEM standard product. The result shows that SPOT produces better DEM results in terms of accuracy and details, if the radiometric variations between the images, taken on subsequent satellite revolutions, are small. Otherwise, the ASTER stereo pair is a better choice because of simultaneous along-track acquisition during a single pass. Compared to the USGS 7.5-min DEM, the ASTER and the SPOT extracted DEMs have a standard deviation of 11.6 and 4.6 m, respectively","['automated digital elevation model extraction', 'across-track SPOT stereo images', 'stereo satellite images', 'along-track ASTER data', 'ASTER stereo pair', 'radiometric variations', 'simultaneous along-track acquisition', 'SPOT stereo image pair']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R']",

917,Efficient transitive closure reasoning in a combined class/part/containment hierarchy,"Class hierarchies form the backbone of many implemented knowledge representation and reasoning systems. They are used for inheritance, classification and transitive closure reasoning. Part hierarchies are also important in artificial intelligence.

This paper presents an architecture and an implementation of a hierarchy reasoner that integrates a class hierarchy, a part hierarchy, and a containment hierarchy into one structure. In order to make an implemented reasoner useful, it needs to operate at least at speeds comparable to human reasoning. As real-world hierarchies are always large, special techniques need to be used to achieve this. We have developed a set of parallel algorithms and a data representation called maximally reduced tree cover for that purpose.

In case of large standing phase angle (SPA) difference the synchro-check relay does not allow closing of the breaker for this line. Therefore, this excessive SPA has to be reduced before attempting to connect the line. In this paper, a new and fast method for reducing SPA is presented. For this purpose, the standing phase angle difference between two specific buses is represented in terms of sensitivity factors associated with the change in active power generations and consumption at the buses.

1376,Enhanced product support through intelligent product manuals,"The scope of this paper is the provision of intelligent product support within the distributed Intranet/Internet environment. From the point of view of user requirements, the limitations of conventional product manuals and methods of authoring them are first outlined. It is argued that enhanced product support requires new technology solutions both for product manuals and for their authoring and presentation. The concept and the architecture of intelligent product manuals are then discussed. A prototype system called ProARTWeb is presented to demonstrate advanced features of intelligent product manuals. Next, the problem of producing such manuals in a cost-effective way is addressed and a concurrent engineering approach to their authoring is proposed. An integrated environment for collaborative authoring called ProAuthor is described to illustrate the approach suggested and to show how consistent, up-to-date and user-oriented-product manuals can be designed. The solutions presented here enable product knowledge to be captured and delivered to users and developers of product manuals when, where and in the form they need it","['intelligent product manuals', 'product manuals', 'intelligent product support', 'ProARTWeb', 'concurrent engineering', 'product knowledge', 'technical information']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'U']",

1077,Quantum learning and universal quantum matching machine,"Suppose that three kinds of quantum systems are given in some unknown states |f>/sup (X)N/, |g/sub 1/>/sup (X)K/, and |g/sub 2/>/sup (X)K/, and we want to decide which template state |g/sub 1/> or |g/sub 2/>, each representing the feature of the pattern class C/sub 1/ or C/sub 2/, respectively, is closest to the input feature state |f>. This is an extension of the pattern matching problem into the quantum domain. Assuming that these states are known a priori to belong to a certain parametric family of pure qubit systems, we derive two kinds of matching strategies. The first one is a semiclassical strategy that is obtained by the natural extension of conventional matching strategies and consists of a two-stage procedure: identification (estimation) of the unknown template states to design the classifier (learning process to train the classifier) and classification of the input system into the appropriate pattern class based on the estimated results. The other is a fully quantum strategy without any intermediate measurement, which we might call as the universal quantum matching machine. We present the Bayes optimal solutions for both strategies in the case of K=1, showing that there certainly exists a fully quantum matching procedure that is strictly superior to the straightforward semiclassical extension of the conventional matching strategy based on the learning process","['quantum learning', 'universal quantum matching machine', 'pattern class', 'pattern matching problem', 'quantum domain', 'qubit systems', 'matching strategies', 'matching strategies', 'semiclassical strategy', 'two-stage procedure', 'learning process', 'quantum strategy', 'Bayes optimal solutions', 'quantum matching procedure', 'semiclassical extension', 'matching strategy']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P']",

1296,Development of visual design steering as an aid in large-scale multidisciplinary design optimization. I. Method development,"A modified paradigm of computational steering (CS), termed visual design steering (VDS), is developed in this paper. The VDS paradigm is applied to optimal design problems to provide a means for capturing and enabling designer insights. VDS allows a designer to make decisions before, during or after an analysis or optimization via a visual environment, in order to effectively steer the solution process. The objective of VDS is to obtain a better solution in less time through the use of designer knowledge and expertise. Using visual representations of complex systems in this manner enables human experience and judgement to be incorporated into the optimal design process at appropriate steps, rather than having traditional black box solvers return solutions from a prescribed input set. Part I of this paper focuses on the research issues pertaining to the Graph Morphing visualization method created to represent an n-dimensional optimization problem using 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional visualizations. Part II investigates the implementation of the VDS paradigm, using the graph morphing approach, to improve an optimal design process. Specifically, the following issues are addressed: impact of design variable changes on the optimal design space; identification of possible constraint redundancies; impact of constraint tolerances on the optimal solution: and smoothness of the objective function contours. It is demonstrated that graph morphing can effectively reduce the complexity and computational time associated with some optimization problems","['visual design steering', 'large-scale multidisciplinary design optimization', 'computational steering', 'optimal design problems', 'visual representations', 'complex systems', 'complexity', 'graph morphing visualization method', 'n-dimensional optimization', 'design variable changes', 'constraint redundancies', 'constraint tolerances', 'computational time', 'designer decision making', '3D visualizations', '2D visualizations', 'objective function contour smoothness']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'M', 'M', 'R']",

The most successful local wind forecasting in this region is achieved by an expert human forecaster with access to numerical weather prediction products. That forecaster's knowledge is expressed as a set of 'rules-of-thumb'. Fuzzy set methodologies have proved well suited for encoding the forecaster's knowledge, and for accommodating the uncertainty inherent in the specification of rules, as well as in subjective and objective input. MEDEX uses fuzzy set theory in two ways: as a fuzzy rule base in the expert system, and for fuzzy pattern matching to select dominant wind circulation patterns as one input to the expert system. The system was developed, tuned, and verified over a two-year period, during which the weather conditions from 539 days were individually analyzed.

The obtained network can be used in the same way as a CPN to model and control dynamic systems, while it has a faster learning speed than the original back-propagation algorithm.

By constructing the optimal performance function as a relative measure of the total kinetic energy, strain energy and input energy of the system, only three design variables need to be considered to achieve a balance between the desired higher damping effect and lower input cost. Modal control analysis is used to interpret the effects of three energy weight factors on the damping ratios and modal voltages and it is shown that the modal damping effect will increase with the kinetic energy weight factor, approaching square root (2/2) as the strain energy weight factor increases and decrease with the input energy weight factor. Numerical results agree well with those from the modal control analysis. Since the control problem is simplified to three design variables only, the computational cost will be greatly reduced and a more accurate structural control analysis becomes more attractive for large systems","['vibration control', 'finite element linear quadratic regulator', 'smart piezoelectric composite plates', 'total weighted energy', 'weighting matrices', 'optimal performance function', 'total kinetic energy', 'strain energy', 'damping effect', 'modal control analysis', 'damping ratios', 'strain energy weight factor', 'numerical results', 'computational cost', 'structural control analysis']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P']",

This paper proposes a novel knowledge intensive multi-agent cooperative/collaborative framework for concurrent intelligent design and assembly planning, which integrates product design, design for assembly, assembly planning, assembly system design, and assembly simulation subjected to econo-technical evaluations. An AI protocol based method is proposed to facilitate the integration of intelligent agents for assembly design, planning, evaluation and simulation processes. A unified class of knowledge intensive Petri nets is defined using the OO knowledge-based Petri net approach and used as an AI protocol for handling both the integration and the negotiation problems among multi-agents. The detailed cooperative/collaborative mechanism and algorithms are given based on the knowledge object cooperation formalisms. As such, the assembly-oriented design system can easily be implemented under the multi-agent-based knowledge-intensive Petri net framework with concurrent integration of multiple cooperative knowledge sources and software.

In this paper, two methods are proposed for the problem. One of the methods is a switching control system by two types of controllers. One of the controllers is a normal controller under small relative displacement of the auxiliary mass, and the other is not effective only for first mode of vibration under large relative displacement of the auxiliary mass. New variable gain control system is constructed by switching these two controllers. The other method is the brake system. In active vibration control, it is necessary to use actuator for active control. By using the actuator, the proposed system puts on the brake to suppress displacement increase of the auxiliary mass under large disturbance input.

This in an extension of the method that we have published for open (nonwedged) fields [Med. Phys. 25, 830-840 (1998)]. Transmission functions for open fields are being used in our clinic for prediction of portal dose images (PDI, i.e., a dose distribution behind the patient in a plane normal to the beam axis), which are compared with PDIs measured with an electronic portal imaging device (EPID). The calculations are based on the planning CT scan of the patient and on the irradiation geometry as determined in the treatment planning process. Input data for the developed algorithm for wedged beams are derived from (the already available) measured input data set for transmission prediction in open beams, which is extended with only a limited set of measurements in the wedged beam. The method has been tested for a PDI plane at 160 cm from the focus, in agreement with the applied focus-to-detector distance of our fluoroscopic EPIDs.

870,Speaker identification from voice using neural networks,"The paper provides three different schemes for speaker identification of personnel from their voice using artificial neural networks. The first scheme recognizes speakers by employing the classical backpropagation algorithm pre-trained with known voice samples of the persons. The second scheme provides a framework for classifying the known training samples of the voice features using a hierarchical architecture realized with a self-organizing feature map neural net. The first scheme is highly robust as it is capable of identifying the personnel from their noisy voice samples, but because of its excessive training time it has limited applications for a large voice database. The second scheme though not so robust as the former, however, can classify an unknown voice sample to its nearest class. The time needed for classification by the first scheme is always unique irrespective of the voice sample. It is proportional to the number of feedforward layers in the network. The time-requirement of the second classification scheme, however, is not free from the voice features and is proportional to the number of 2D arrays traversed by the algorithm on the hierarchical structure.

1272,Global action rules in distributed knowledge systems,"Previously Z. Ras and J.M. Zytkow (2000) introduced and investigated query answering system based on distributed knowledge mining. The notion of an action rule was introduced by Z. Ras and A. Wieczorkowska (2000) and its application domain e-business was taken. In this paper, we generalize the notion of action rules in a similar way to handling global queries. Mainly, when values of attributes for a given customer, used in action rules, can not be easily changed by business user, definitions of these attributes are extracted from other sites of a distributed knowledge system. To be more precise, attributes at every site of a distributed knowledge system are divided into two sets: stable and flexible. Values of flexible attributes, for a given consumer, sometime can be changed and this change can be influenced and controlled by a business user. However, some of these changes (for instance to the attribute ""profit') can not be done directly to a chosen attribute. In this case, definitions of such an attribute in terms of other attributes have to be learned. These new definitions are used to construct action rules showing what changes in values of flexible attributes, for a given consumer, are needed in order to re-classify this consumer the way business user wants. But, business user may be either unable or unwilling to proceed with actions leading to such changes. In all such cases we may search for definitions of these flexible attributes looking at either local or remote sites for help","['global action rules', 'action rules', 'query answering system', 'distributed knowledge mining', 'attributes', 'e-commerce']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'U']",
1237,High-performance numerical pricing methods,"The pricing of financial derivatives is an important field in finance and constitutes a major component of financial management applications. The uncertainty of future events often makes analytic approaches infeasible and, hence, time-consuming numerical simulations are required. In the Aurora Financial Management System, pricing is performed on the basis of lattice representations of stochastic multidimensional scenario processes using the Monte Carlo simulation and Backward Induction methods, the latter allowing for the exploitation of shared-memory parallelism. We present the parallelization of a Backward Induction numerical pricing kernel on a cluster of SMPs using HPF+, an extended version of High-Performance Fortran. Based on language extensions for specifying a hierarchical mapping of data onto an SMP cluster, the compiler generates a hybrid-parallel program combining distributed-memory and shared-memory parallelism.

58,Robust speech recognition using probabilistic union models,"This paper introduces a new statistical approach, namely the probabilistic union model, for speech recognition involving partial, unknown frequency-band corruption. Partial frequency-band corruption accounts for the effect of a family of real-world noises. Previous methods based on the missing feature theory usually require the identity of the noisy bands. This identification can be difficult for unexpected noise with unknown, time-varying band characteristics. The new model combines the local frequency-band information based on the union of random events, to reduce the dependence of the model on information about the noise. This model partially accomplishes the target: offering robustness to partial frequency-band corruption, while requiring no information about the noise. This paper introduces the theory and implementation of the union model, and is focused on several important advances. These new developments include a new algorithm for automatic order selection, a generalization of the modeling principle to accommodate partial feature stream corruption, and a combination of the union model with conventional noise reduction techniques to deal with a mixture of stationary noise and unknown, nonstationary noise. For the evaluation, we used the TIDIGITS database for speaker-independent connected digit recognition. The utterances were corrupted by various types of additive noise, stationary or time-varying, assuming no knowledge about the noise characteristics. The results indicate that the new model offers significantly improved robustness in comparison to other models","['robust speech recognition', 'probabilistic union models', 'modeling', 'partial frequency-band corruption', 'missing feature theory', 'noisy bands', 'time-varying band characteristics', 'local frequency-band information', 'automatic order selection', 'partial feature stream corruption', 'noise reduction techniques', 'stationary noise', 'nonstationary noise', 'TIDIGITS database', 'speaker-independent connected digit recognition', 'additive noise', 'noise characteristics', 'partial real-world noise']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R']",

1442,Using constructed types in C++ unions,"The C++ Standard states that a union type cannot have a member with a nontrivial constructor or destructor. While at first this seems unreasonable, further thought makes it clear why this is the case: The crux of the problem is that unions don't have built-in semantics for denoting when a member is the ""current"" member of the union. Therefore, the compiler can't know when it's appropriate to call constructors or destructors on the union members. Still, there are good reasons for wanting to use constructed object types in a union. For example, you might want to implement a scripting language with a single variable type that can either be an integer, a string, or a list. A union is the perfect candidate for implementing such a composite type, but the restriction on constructed union members may prevent you from using an existing string or list class (for example, from the STL) to provide the underlying functionality. Luckily, a feature of C++ called placement new can provide a workaround","['C++ Standard', 'union type', 'constructors', 'destructors', 'union members', 'scripting language', 'placement new']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P']",

The formation of relatively stable long-term group associations (community in the broad sense of the term), is the scene on which a large share of human development occurs. As such it is a fundamental human value mobilizing diverse ideologies and sensitivities. The promise of realizing this value in a new domain naturally stirs up much excitement among optimistic observers of the Internet. At the same time, the eagerness to place hopes for community in a technical system flies in the face of an influential intellectual tradition of technology criticism. This eagerness seems even more naive in the light of the recent commercialization of so much Internet activity. Despite the widespread skepticism, we believe the growth of virtual community is significant for an inquiry into the democratization of technology. We show that conflicting answers to the central question of the present theoretical debate - Is community possible on computer networks? epsilon neralize from particular features of systems and software prevalent at different stages in the development of computer networking.

Twenty solitary lung nodules smaller than 30 mm in diameter, including 10 lung cancers and 10 benign nodules, were used. The nodules were grouped subjectively according to their subtlety. For nonnodular cases, 20 nodules without perceptible interval changes were selected. All chest radiographs were obtained by using a computed radiographic system, and temporal subtraction images were produced by using a program developed at the University of Chicago. The effect of the temporal subtraction image was evaluated by using an observer performance study, with use of receiver operating characteristic analysis. Observer performance with temporal subtraction images was substantially improved (A/sub z/ = 0.980 and 0.958), as compared with that without temporal subtraction images (A/sub z/ = 0.920 and 0.825) for the certified radiologists and radiology residents, respectively.

1016,A scalable model of cerebellar adaptive timing and sequencing: the recurrent slide and latch (RSL) model,"From the dawn of modern neural network theory, the mammalian cerebellum has been a favored object of mathematical modeling studies. Early studies focused on the fanout, convergence, thresholding, and learned weighting of perceptual-motor signals within the cerebellar cortex. This led to the still viable idea that the granule cell stage in the cerebellar cortex performs a sparse expansive recoding of the time-varying input vector. This recoding reveals and emphasizes combinations in a distributed representation that serves as a basis for the learned, state-dependent control actions engendered by cerebellar outputs to movement related centers. To make optimal use of available signals, the cerebellum must be able to sift the evolving state representation for the most reliable predictors of the need for control actions, and to use those predictors even if they appear only transiently and well in advance of the optimal time for initiating the control action. The paper proposes a modification to prior, population, models for cerebellar adaptive timing and sequencing. Since it replaces a population with a single element, the proposed RSL model is in one sense maximally efficient, and therefore optimal from the perspective of scalability","['scalable model', 'cerebellar adaptive timing', 'neural network theory', 'mammalian cerebellum', 'granule cell stage', 'sparse expansive recoding', 'time-varying input vector', 'distributed representation', 'cerebellar sequencing', 'recurrent slide and latch model', 'recurrent network']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'R', 'R']",

The semantics formally specifies nearly all the details of the Haskell 98 type system, including the resolution of overloading, kind inference (including defaulting) and polymorphic recursion, the only major omission being a proper treatment of ambiguous overloading and its resolution. Overloading is translated into explicit dictionary passing, as in all current implementations of Haskell. The target language of this translation is a variant of the Girard-Reynolds polymorphic lambda calculus featuring higher order polymorphism. and explicit type abstraction and application in the term language. Translated programs can thus still be type checked, although the implicit version of this system is impredicative.

1317,Dynamic spectrum management for next-generation DSL systems,"The performance of DSL systems is severely constrained by crosstalk due to the electromagnetic coupling among the multiple twisted pairs making up a phone cable. In order to reduce performance loss arising from crosstalk, DSL systems are currently designed under the assumption of worst-case crosstalk scenarios leading to overly conservative DSL deployments. This article presents a new paradigm for DSL system design, which takes into account the multi-user aspects of the DSL transmission environment. Dynamic spectrum management (DSM) departs from the current design philosophy by enabling transceivers to autonomously and dynamically optimize their communication settings with respect to both the channel and the transmissions of neighboring systems. Along with this distributed optimization, when an additional degree of coordination becomes available for future DSL deployment, DSM will allow even greater improvement in DSL performance. Implementations are readily applicable without causing any performance degradation to the existing DSLs under static spectrum management. After providing an overview of the DSM concept, this article reviews two practical DSM methods: iterative water-filling, an autonomous distributed power control method enabling great improvement in performance, which can be implemented through software options in some existing ADSL and VDSL systems; and vectored-DMT, a coordinated transmission/reception technique achieving crosstalk-free communication for DSL systems, which brings within reach the dream of providing universal Internet access at speeds close to 100 Mb/s to 500 m on 1-2 lines and beyond 1 km on 2-4 lines.

The novelty of the technique is that the model's elastic parameters are not constant, but spatio-temporally varying. The variation of the elastic parameters depends on the distance of the model from the data and the rate of change of this distance. Each pass of the algorithm uses physics-based modeling techniques to iteratively adjust both the geometric and the elastic degrees of freedom of the model in response to forces that are computed from the discrepancy between the model and the data. By augmenting the state equations of an extended Kalman filter to incorporate these additional variables, we are able to significantly improve the quality of the shape estimation. Therefore, the model's elastic parameters are always initialized to the same value and they are subsequently modified depending on the data and the noise distribution. We present results demonstrating the effectiveness of our method for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional data","['elastically adaptive deformable models', 'automatic adaptation', 'elastic parameters', 'Kalman filter framework', 'shape estimation', 'physics-based modeling techniques', 'elastic degrees of freedom', 'state equations', 'extended Kalman filter', 'geometric degrees of freedom']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R']",

137,An efficient DIPIE algorithm for CAD of electrostatically actuated MEMS devices,"Pull-in parameters are important properties of electrostatic actuators. Efficient and accurate analysis tools that can capture these parameters for different design geometries, are therefore essential. Current simulation tools approach the pull-in state by iteratively adjusting the voltage applied across the actuator electrodes. The convergence rate of this scheme gradually deteriorates as the pull-in state is approached. Moreover, the convergence is inconsistent and requires many mesh and accuracy refinements to assure reliable predictions. As a result, the design procedure of electrostatically actuated MEMS devices can be time-consuming. In this paper a novel Displacement Iteration Pull-In Extraction (DIPIE) scheme is presented. The DIPIE scheme is shown to converge consistently and far more rapidly than the Voltage Iterations (VI) scheme (>100 times faster!). The DIPIE scheme requires separate mechanical and electrostatic field solvers. Therefore, it can be easily implemented in existing MOEMS CAD packages.

A circular source locus (equivalent to rotating specimen with a fixed source) provides insufficient data for 'exact' reconstruction in cone-beam transmission tomography, thus phantom data are useful for studying the consequent errors and also for investigating alternative scanning loci and reconstruction techniques. We present an algorithm that can compute phantom cone-beam projection data from a phantom comprising geometrically defined polyhedra. Each polyhedron is defined as a set of polygons enclosing a volume of fixed linear attenuation coefficient. The algorithm works by projecting each polygon in turn onto the modelled detector array, which accumulates the product of source to polygon intersection distance (for the rays intersecting each detector element), linear attenuation coefficient and sign of projected polygon area (indicating whether rays enter or exit the polyhedron at this face). The phantom data are rotated according to the projection angle, whilst the source location and detector plane remain fixed. Polyhedra can be of simple geometric form, or complex surfaces derived from 3D images of real specimens.

The use of the term ""python"" is given as an example. Machine indexing is noted as ""rotten"" and human indexing as ""capricious."" The problem seems to be a lack of a theoretical foundation for the art of indexing. What librarians have learned over the last hundred years has yet to yield a consistent approach to what really works best in preparing index terms and in the ability of our customers to search the various indexes. An attempt is made to consider the elements of indexing, their pros and cons. The argument is made that machine indexing is far too prolific in its production of index terms.

1206,"The MAGNeT toolkit: design, implementation and evaluation","The current trend in constructing high-performance computing systems is to connect a large number of machines via a fast interconnect or a large-scale network such as the Internet. This approach relies on the performance of the interconnect (or Internet) to enable fast, large-scale distributed computing. A detailed understanding of the communication traffic is required in order to optimize the operation of the entire system. Network researchers traditionally monitor traffic in the network to gain the insight necessary to optimize network operations. Recent work suggests additional insight can be obtained by also monitoring traffic at the application level.

HPF has been effective for programs that a compiler can automatically optimize efficiently. However, once the compiler cannot, there have been no ways for the users to explicitly parallelize or optimize their programs. In order to resolve the situation, we have developed a set of HPF extensions (HPF/JA) to give the users more control over sophisticated parallelization and communication optimizations. They include parallelization of loops with complicated reductions, asynchronous communication, user-controllable shadow, and communication pattern reuse for irregular remote data accesses. Preliminary experiments have proved that the extensions are effective at increasing HPF's usability","['HPF', 'High Performance Fortran', 'compiler', 'parallelization of loops', 'parallel processing', 'data parallel language', 'supercomputer', 'parallel programming']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'M', 'M', 'U', 'R']",

These systems are locally active everywhere except for one isolated parameter value. As a result, nonhomogeneous spatiotemporal patterns may be induced by any initial setting of the CNN system when the strength of the system diffusion coupling exceeds a critical threshold. The critical coupling coefficient can be derived from the loaded cell impedance of the CNN system. Three well-known 1D map CNN's (namely, the logistic map CNN, the magnetic vortex pinning map CNN, and the spiral wave reproducing map CNN) are introduced to illustrate the applications of the local activity principle.

Second, the geometry is associated with a large, diverse knowledge base of dimensional metrology with many interconnections. This paper describes an approach to create a dimensional metrology knowledge base that is organized around a set of key concepts and to represent those concepts as virtual objects that can be navigated with interactive, computer visualization techniques to access the associated knowledge. The approach can enable several applications. First is the application to convey the definition and meaning of GD&T over a broad range of tolerance types. Second is the application to provide a visualization of dimensional metrology knowledge within a control hierarchy of the inspection process.

1142,Fast and accurate leaf verification for dynamic multileaf collimation using an electronic portal imaging device,"A prerequisite for accurate dose delivery of IMRT profiles produced with dynamic multileaf collimation (DMLC) is highly accurate leaf positioning. In our institution, leaf verification for DMLC was initially done with film and ionization chamber. To overcome the limitations of these methods, a fast, accurate and two-dimensional method for daily leaf verification, using our CCD-camera based electronic portal imaging device (EPID), has been developed. This method is based on a flat field produced with a 0.5 cm wide sliding gap for each leaf pair. Deviations in gap widths are detected as deviations in gray scale value profiles derived from the EPID images, and not by directly assessing leaf positions in the images. Dedicated software was developed to reduce the noise level in the low signal images produced with the narrow gaps. The accuracy of this quality assurance procedure was tested by introducing known leaf position errors. It was shown that errors in leaf gap as small as 0.01-0.02 cm could be detected, which is certainly adequate to guarantee accurate dose delivery of DMLC treatments, even for strongly modulated beam profiles. Using this method, it was demonstrated that both short and long term reproducibility in leaf positioning were within 0.01 cm (1 sigma ) for all gantry angles, and that the effect of gravity was negligible","['accurate leaf verification', 'dynamic multileaf collimation', 'electronic portal imaging device', 'accurate dose delivery', 'leaf positioning', 'ionization chamber', 'two-dimensional method', 'CCD-camera based electronic portal imaging device', 'sliding gap', 'leaf pair', 'gap widths', 'gray scale value profiles', 'noise level', 'signal images', 'leaf position errors', 'modulated beam profiles', 'gantry angles', 'intensity modulated radiation therapy profiles', 'electronic portal imaging device images']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'M', 'R']",

An optimum weighting function for the memory registers is theoretically derived. The optimum time-dependent weighting function allows sorting and clustering of the randomly distributed objects in the shortest time.

11,Does social capital determine innovation? To what extent?,"This paper deals with two questions: Does social capital determine innovation in manufacturing firms? If it is the case, to what extent? To deal with these questions, we review the literature on innovation in order to see how social capital came to be added to the other forms of capital as an explanatory variable of innovation. In doing so, we have been led to follow the dominating view of the literature on social capital and innovation which claims that social capital cannot be captured through a single indicator, but that it actually takes many different forms that must be accounted for. Therefore, to the traditional explanatory variables of innovation, we have added five forms of structural social capital (business network assets, information network assets, research network assets, participation assets, and relational assets) and one form of cognitive social capital (reciprocal trust).

If the quantum channels are subject to isotropic noise, the average fidelity decays to 1/2, which is smaller than the best possible value of 2/3 obtained only by the classical communication.

Each viewpoint offers a different perspective on the target system and system development involves parallel refinement of the multiple views. Viewpoint related approaches have been considered in a number of different guises by a spectrum of researchers. Our work particularly focuses on the use of viewpoints in open distributed processing (ODP) which is an ISO/ITU standardisation framework. The requirements of viewpoint modelling in ODP are very broad and, hence, demanding. Multiple viewpoints, though, prompt the issue of consistency between viewpoints. This paper describes a very general interpretation of consistency which we argue is broad enough to meet the requirements of consistency in ODP. We present a formal framework for this general interpretation; highlight basic properties of the interpretation and locate restricted classes of consistency. Strategies for checking consistency are also investigated. Throughout we illustrate our theory using the formal description technique LOTOS.

961,Modular and visual specification of hybrid systems: an introduction to HyCharts,"Visual description techniques are particularly important for the design of hybrid systems, because specifications of such systems usually have to be discussed between engineers from a number of different disciplines. Modularity is vital for hybrid systems not only because it allows to handle large systems, but also because it permits to think in terms of components, which is familiar to engineers. Based on two different interpretations for hierarchic graphs and on a clear hybrid computation model, we develop HyCharts. HyCharts consist of two modular visual formalisms, one for the specification of the architecture and one for the specification of the behavior of hybrid systems. The operators on hierarchic graphs enable us to give a surprisingly simple denotational semantics for many concepts known from statechart-like formalisms. Due to a very general composition operator, HyCharts can easily be composed with description techniques from other engineering disciplines. Such heterogeneous system specifications seem to be particularly appropriate for hybrid systems because of their interdisciplinary character","['visual specification', 'hybrid systems', 'HyCharts', 'visual description techniques', 'components', 'hierarchic graphs', 'hybrid computation model', 'denotational semantics', 'heterogeneous system specifications', 'modular specification', 'statechart', 'formal specification']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'U', 'R']",

Both smart materials can be integrated unobtrusively into the skin of a torus or space device forming an attractive testing arrangement. The addition of actuators and PVDF sensors to the torus does not significantly interfere with the suspension modes of a free-free boundary condition, and can be considered an integral part of the inflated structure.

1347,A maximum-likelihood surface estimator for dense range data,"Describes how to estimate 3D surface models from dense sets of noisy range data taken from different points of view, i.e., multiple range maps. The proposed method uses a sensor model to develop an expression for the likelihood of a 3D surface, conditional on a set of noisy range measurements. Optimizing this likelihood with respect to the model parameters provides an unbiased and efficient estimator. The proposed numerical algorithms make this estimation computationally practical for a wide variety of circumstances.

1302,Dynamics of the firing probability of noisy integrate-and-fire neurons,"Cortical neurons in vivo undergo a continuous bombardment due to synaptic activity, which acts as a major source of noise. We investigate the effects of the noise filtering by synapses with various levels of realism on integrate-and-fire neuron dynamics. The noise input is modeled by white (for instantaneous synapses) or colored (for synapses with a finite relaxation time) noise. Analytical results for the modulation of firing probability in response to an oscillatory input current are obtained by expanding a Fokker-Planck equation for small parameters of the problem-when both the amplitude of the modulation is small compared to the background firing rate and the synaptic time constant is small compared to the membrane time constant. We report the detailed calculations showing that if a synaptic decay time constant is included in the synaptic current model, the firing-rate modulation of the neuron due to an oscillatory input remains finite in the high-frequency limit with no phase lag. In addition, we characterize the low-frequency behavior and the behavior of the high-frequency limit for intermediate decay times. We also characterize the effects of introducing a rise time to the synaptic currents and the presence of several synaptic receptors with different kinetics. In both cases, we determine, using numerical simulations, an effective decay time constant that describes the neuronal response completely","['firing probability', 'noisy integrate-and-fire neurons', 'cortical neurons', 'synaptic activity', 'noise filtering', 'Fokker-Planck equation', 'synaptic time constant', 'membrane time constant', 'phase lag', 'synaptic receptors', 'numerical simulation', 'white noise', 'colored noise']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'R']",
757,Ultrafast compound imaging for 2-D motion vector estimation: application to transient elastography,"This paper describes a new technique for two-dimensional (2-D) imaging of the motion vector at a very high frame rate with ultrasound. Its potential is experimentally demonstrated for transient elastography. But, beyond this application, it also could be promising for color flow and reflectivity imaging. To date, only axial displacements induced in human tissues by low-frequency vibrators were measured during transient elastography. The proposed technique allows us to follow both axial and lateral displacements during the shear wave propagation and thus should improve Young's modulus image reconstruction. The process is a combination of several ideas well-known in ultrasonic imaging: ultra-fast imaging, multisynthetic aperture beamforming, 1-D speckle tracking, and compound imaging. Classical beamforming in the transmit mode is replaced here by a single plane wave insonification increasing the frame rate by at least a factor of 128. The beamforming is achieved only in the receive mode on two independent subapertures. Comparison of successive frames by a classical 1-D speckle tracking algorithm allows estimation of displacements along two different directions linked to the subapertures beams. The variance of the estimates is finally improved by tilting the emitting plane wave at each insonification, thus allowing reception of successive decorrelated speckle patterns","['ultrafast compound imaging', 'transient elastography', 'high frame rate', 'ultrasound', 'reflectivity imaging', 'axial displacements', 'human tissues', 'lateral displacements', 'shear wave propagation', ""Young's modulus image reconstruction"", 'ultrasonic imaging', 'multisynthetic aperture beamforming', 'single plane wave insonification', 'decorrelated speckle patterns', '2D motion vector estimation', 'two-dimensional imaging', '2D imaging', 'colour flow imaging', '1D speckle tracking algorithm']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'M', 'R', 'M', 'M', 'M']",

We present a brief overview of interval Taylor series (ITS) methods for IVPs for ODEs and discuss some recent advances in the theory of validated methods for IVPs for ODEs. In particular, we discuss an interval Hermite-Obreschkoff (IHO) scheme for computing rigorous bounds on the solution of an IVP for an ODE, the stability of ITS and IHO methods, and a new perspective on the wrapping effect, where we interpret the problem of reducing the wrapping effect as one of finding a more stable scheme for advancing the solution","['validated methods', 'initial value problems', 'ordinary differential equations', 'interval methods', 'interval Taylor series', 'wrapping effect', 'interval Hermite-Obreschkoff scheme', 'QR algorithm']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'U']",

797,Adaptive wavelet methods. II. Beyond the elliptic case,"This paper is concerned with the design and analysis of adaptive wavelet methods for systems of operator equations. Its main accomplishment is to extend the range of applicability of the adaptive wavelet-based method developed previously for symmetric positive definite problems to indefinite or unsymmetric systems of operator equations. This is accomplished by first introducing techniques (such as the least squares formulation developed previously) that transform the original (continuous) problem into an equivalent infinite system of equations which is now well-posed in the Euclidean metric. It is then shown how to utilize adaptive techniques to solve the resulting infinite system of equations. It is shown that for a wide range of problems, this new adaptive method performs with asymptotically optimal complexity, i.e., it recovers an approximate solution with desired accuracy at a computational expense that stays proportional to the number of terms in a corresponding wavelet-best N-term approximation. An important advantage of this adaptive approach is that it automatically stabilizes the numerical procedure so that, for instance, compatibility constraints on the choice of trial spaces, like the LBB condition, no longer arise","['adaptive wavelet methods', 'elliptic case', 'operator equations', 'least squares formulation', 'Euclidean metric', 'asymptotically optimal complexity', 'N-term approximation']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P']",

The modelling of the dependencies is embedded in the analysis of multiple binomial responses, which has the advantage of interpretability in terms of conditional odds ratios.

Next, the flow is optimally corrected so that it satisfies the epipolar equation exactly. Finally, the 3D positions are computed, and their covariance matrices are evaluated.

In addition, two cache replacement policies, PA and PAID, are proposed. Unlike the conventional replacement policies, PA and PAID take into consideration the valid scope area of a data value. We conduct a series of simulation experiments to study the performance of the proposed caching schemes.

1265,Optimization of requantization parameter for MPEG transcoding,"This paper considers transcoding in which an MPEG stream is converted to a low-bit-rate MPEG stream, and proposes a method in which the transcoding error can be reduced by optimally selecting the quantization parameter for each macroblock. In transcoding with a low compression ratio, it is crucial to prohibit transcoding with a requantization parameter which is 1 to 2 times the quantization parameter of the input stream. Consequently, as the first step, an optimization method for the requantization parameter is proposed which cares for the error propagation effect by interframe prediction. Then, the proposed optimization method is extended so that the method can also be applied to the case of a high compression ratio in which the rate-distortion curve is approximated for each macroblock in the range of requantization parameters larger than 2 times the quantization parameter. It is verified by a simulation experiment that the PSNR is improved by 0.5 to 0.8 dB compared to the case in which a 6 Mbit/s MPEG stream is not optimized by twofold recompression","['low-bit-rate MPEG stream', 'transcoding error', 'macroblock', 'compression ratio', 'error propagation effect', 'interframe prediction', 'rate-distortion curve', 'simulation', 'PSNR', '6 Mbit/s', 'twofold recompression', 'requantization parameter optimization', 'rate conversion', 'rate control']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'U', 'U']",

This novel approach, called wavepath, reduces the influence of the user-defined start- and endpoints of the vessel segment and is therefore more robust and improves the reproducibility of the lesion quantification substantially. The validation study shows that the wavepath method is totally constant in the middle part of the pathline, even when using the method for constructing a bifurcation or sidebranch pathline. Furthermore, the number of corrections needed to guide the wavepath through the correct vessel is decreased from an average of 0.44 corrections per pathline to an average of 0.12 per pathline.

1121,Optimal bandwidth utilization of all-optical ring with a converter of degree 4,"In many models of all-optical routing, a set of communication paths in a network is given, and a wavelength is to be assigned to each path so that paths sharing an edge receive different wavelengths. The goal is to assign as few wavelengths as possible, in order to use the optical bandwidth efficiently. If a node of a network contains a wavelength converter, any path that passes through this node may change its wavelength. Having converters at some of the nodes can reduce the number of wavelengths required for routing. This paper presents a wavelength converter with degree 4 and gives a routing algorithm which shows that any routing with load L can be realized with L wavelengths when a node of an all-optical ring hosts such a wavelength converter. It is also proved that 4 is the minimum degree of the converter to reach the full utilization of the available wavelengths if only one node of an all-optical ring hosts a converter","['all-optical ring', 'all-optical routing', 'communication paths', 'wavelength converter', 'all-optical network', 'wavelength assignment', 'wavelength translation']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'R', 'M']",

In this paper, we further extend our analysis by considering a generalization of the previous model in which the rate of packet emission is regulated by the local congestion perceived by each node.

The role of the classically conditioned component is to develop an expectation of future benefit that is a function of the learning system's state and action. Competition among the instrumentally conditioned components determines the overt behavior generated by the learning system. Our model displays, in simulation, the reduced latency of the avoidance behavior during learning with continuing trials and the resistance to extinction of the avoidance response.

Various general-purpose simulation libraries and languages have been proposed, and among these some have the advantage of not requiring users to define anything other than the state vector, and not needing awareness of rollback under a platform which performs state control based on copies. However, because the state vectors must be defined as simple data structures without pointers, dynamic data structures such as a FIFO queue cannot be handled directly. Under the proposed class library, both the platform and the user can handle such structures in the same fashion that embedded data structures are handled. In addition, instead of all stored data, just the operational history can be stored and recovered efficiently at an effectively minimal cost by taking advantage of the first-in-first-out characteristics of the above data structures.

Each target is in general characterized by multiple classes. A distinct set of Wiener filters are employed for each class of images, to identify the presence of target subcomponents.

The platform, used in conjunction with an analog front-end hardware for driving the ultrasonic transducers of any commercial echograph, having the radiofrequency echo signal access, make it possible to dispose of a powerful echographic system for experimenting any processing technique, also in a clinical environment in which real-time operation mode is an essential prerequisite. The platform transforms any echograph into a test-system for evaluating the diagnostic effectiveness of new investigation techniques. A particular user interface was designed in order to allow a real-time and simultaneous visualization of the results produced in the different stages of the chosen processing procedure. This is aimed at obtaining a better optimization of the processing algorithm. The most important platform aspect, which also constitutes the basic differentiation with respect to similar systems, is the direct processing of the radiofrequency echo signal, which is essential for a complete analysis of the particular ultrasound-media interaction phenomenon. The platform completely integrates the architecture of a personal computer (PC) giving rise to several benefits, such as the quick technological evolution in the PC field and an extreme degree of programmability for different applications.

LOT concerns the semantically relevant structure of representations involved in cognitive states such as beliefs and desires. It maintains that all such representations must have syntactic structures mirroring the structure of their contents. IBS is a thesis about the nature of the relations that connect cognitive representations and their parts to their contents (semantic relations). It holds that these relations supervene solely on relations of the kind that support information content, perhaps with some help from logical principles of combination. Atomism is a thesis about the nature of the content of simple symbols. It holds that each substantive simple symbol possesses its content independently of all other symbols in the representational system.

883,On conflict-free executions of elementary nets,"Deals with analysis of elementary Petri nets with respect to possibilities of avoiding conflicts during their executions. There are two main aims of the paper. The first is to find a method of checking if a net is conflict-avoidable (i.e., if it possesses a conflict-free fair run). The second is to find a method of rebuilding any net to a totally conflict-avoidable net (i.e., a net possessing a conflict-free fair run in every one process) with the same behaviour. The main results are the following: 1. The proof of decidability, for elementary nets, of the problem of existence of a conflict-avoidable fair process (and an algorithm producing all fair runs). 2. Construction, for an arbitrary given elementary net, of a totally conflict-avoidable net with the same behaviour. The net, completed this way, has the same behaviour as the original one.

As a measure of compensation for this, it has been recommended in literature that EMs are implemented several times with different sets of initial values to obtain more appropriate estimates.

It is known that the fully entangled fraction has a direct relationship to the fidelity of teleportation maximized under the actions of local unitary operations. In the case of two qubits we point out that the fully entangled fraction can also be related to the fidelities, maximized under the actions of local unitary operations, of other important quantum information tasks such as dense coding, entanglement swapping and quantum cryptography in such a way as to provide an inclusive measure of these entanglement applications. For two qubit systems the fully entangled fraction has a simple known closed-form expression and we establish lower and upper bounds of this quantity with the concurrence.

This new microinjector uses asymmetric bubbles to reduce crosstalk, increase frequency response and eliminate satellite droplets.

Between firings, however, the virtual valve opens, by collapsing the bubble, to reduce flow restriction for fast refilling of the microchamber. The use of bubble valves brings about fast and reliable device operation without imposing the significant complication fabrication of physical microvalves would call for.

Two principal issues were studied: (a) the number of varieties that could be classified correctly; and (b) various means of preprocessing mass spectrometric data. The number of wheat varieties tested was increased from 10 to 30. The main pre-processing method investigated was based on Gaussian smoothing of the spectra, but other methods based on normalisation procedures and multiplicative scatter correction of data were also used.

1025,Watermarking techniques for electronic delivery of remote sensing images,"Earth observation missions have recently attracted a growing interest, mainly due to the large number of possible applications capable of exploiting remotely sensed data and images. Along with the increase of market potential, the need arises for the protection of the image products. Such a need is a very crucial one, because the Internet and other public/private networks have become preferred means of data exchange. A critical issue arising when dealing with digital image distribution is copyright protection. Such a problem has been largely addressed by resorting to watermarking technology. A question that obviously arises is whether the requirements imposed by remote sensing imagery are compatible with existing watermarking techniques. On the basis of these motivations, the contribution of this work is twofold: assessment of the requirements imposed by remote sensing applications on watermark-based copyright protection, and modification of two well-established digital watermarking techniques to meet such constraints. More specifically, the concept of near-lossless watermarking is introduced and two possible algorithms matching such a requirement are presented. Experimental results are shown to measure the impact of watermark introduction on a typical remote sensing application, i.e., unsupervised image classification","['watermarking techniques', 'electronic delivery', 'remote sensing images', 'Earth observation missions', 'digital image distribution', 'copyright protection', 'digital watermarking', 'near-lossless watermarking', 'unsupervised image classification']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P']",
1361,Adaptive scheduling of batch servers in flow shops,"Batch servicing is a common way of benefiting from economies of scale in manufacturing operations. Good examples of production systems that allow for batch processing are ovens found in the aircraft industry and in semiconductor manufacturing. In this paper we study the issue of dynamic scheduling of such systems within the context of multi-stage flow shops. So far, a great deal of research has concentrated on the development of control strategies, which only address the batch stage. This paper proposes an integral scheduling approach that also includes succeeding stages. In this way, we aim for shop optimization, instead of optimizing performance for a single stage. Our so-called look-ahead strategy adapts its scheduling decision to shop status, which includes information on a limited number of near-future arrivals. In particular, we study a two-stage flow shop, in which the batch stage is succeeded by a serial stage. The serial stage may be realized by a single machine or by parallel machines. Through an extensive simulation study it is demonstrated how shop performance can be improved by the proposed strategy relative to existing strategies","['adaptive scheduling', 'batch servers', 'flow shops', 'batch servicing', 'manufacturing operations', 'production systems', 'ovens', 'aircraft industry', 'semiconductor manufacturing', 'dynamic scheduling', 'multi-stage flow shops', 'control strategies', 'integral scheduling approach', 'shop optimization', 'look-ahead strategy', 'near-future arrivals', 'two-stage flow shop', 'single machine', 'parallel machines', 'simulation study']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P']",

771,Pareto-optimal formulations for cost versus colorimetric accuracy trade-offs in printer color management,"Color management for the printing of digital images is a challenging task, due primarily to nonlinear ink-mixing behavior and the presence of redundant solutions for print devices with more than three inks. Algorithms for the conversion of image data to printer-specific format are typically designed to achieve a single predetermined rendering intent, such as colorimetric accuracy. We present two CIELAB to CMYK color conversion schemes based on a general Pareto-optimal formulation for printer color management. The schemes operate using a 149-color characterization data set selected to efficiently capture the entire CMYK gamut. The first scheme uses artificial neural networks as transfer functions between the CIELAB and CMYK spaces. The second scheme is based on a reformulation of tetrahedral interpolation as an optimization problem. Characterization data are divided into tetrahedra for the interpolation-based approach using the program Qhull, which removes the common restriction that characterization data be well organized. Both schemes offer user control over trade-off problems such as cost versus reproduction accuracy, allowing for user-specified print objectives and the use of constraints such as maximum allowable ink and maximum allowable AE*/sub ab/.

The classification was performed using the normalized parameters of the Nakagami distribution at a single region of interest at the site of the mass. A combination of normalized Nakagami parameters from two different images of a mass was undertaken to improve the performance of classification. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that such an approach resulted in an area of 0.83 under the ROC curve. The aim of the work described in this paper is to see whether a feature describing the characteristic of the boundary can be extracted and combined with the Nakagami parameter to further improve the performance of classification. The combination of the features has been performed using a weighted summation. Results indicate a 10% improvement in specificity at a sensitivity of 96% after combining the information at the site and at the boundary.

Here, applications arrange themselves in a logical overlay network and transfer data within the overlay. We present an application-layer multicast solution that uses a Delaunay triangulation as an overlay network topology. An advantage of using a Delaunay triangulation is that it allows each application to locally derive next-hop routing information without requiring a routing protocol in the overlay. A disadvantage of using a Delaunay triangulation is that the mapping of the overlay to the network topology at the network and data link layer may be suboptimal. We present a protocol, called Delaunay triangulation (DT protocol), which constructs Delaunay triangulation overlay networks. We present measurement experiments of the DT protocol for overlay networks with up to 10 000 members, that are running on a local PC cluster with 100 Linux PCs. The results show that the protocol stabilizes quickly, e.g., an overlay network with 10 000 nodes can be built in just over 30 s. The traffic measurements indicate that the average overhead of a node is only a few kilobits per second if the overlay network is in a steady state.

Understanding hydrogel properties is also important from the standpoint of their similarity to many biological tissues. Typically, gel size is sensitive to outer solution pH and salt concentration. In this paper, we develop models to predict the swelling/deswelling of hydrogels in buffered pH solutions. An equilibrium model has been developed to predict the degree of swelling of the hydrogel at a given pH and salt concentration in the solution. A kinetic model has been developed to predict the rate of swelling of the hydrogel when the solution pH is changed. Experiments are performed to characterize the mechanical properties of the hydrogel in different pH solutions.

An efficient deadlock-free scheduling algorithm was developed, using timed Petri nets, for a class of FMSs called Systems of Sequential Systems with Shared Resources (S/sup 4/ R). The algorithm generates a partial reachability graph to find the optimal or near-optimal deadlock-free schedule in terms of the firing sequence of the transitions of the Petri net model. The objective is to minimize the mean flow time (MFT). An efficient truncation technique, based on the siphon concept, has been developed and used to generate the minimum necessary portion of the reachability graph to be searched. It has been shown experimentally that the developed siphon truncation technique enhances the ability to develop deadlock-free schedules of systems with a high number of deadlocks, which cannot be achieved using standard Petri net scheduling approaches. It may be necessary, in some cases, to relax the optimality condition for large FMSs in order to make the search effort reasonable. Hence, a User Control Factor (UCF) was defined and used in the scheduling algorithm. The objective of using the UCF is to achieve an acceptable trade-off between the solution quality and the search effort. Its effect on the MFT and the CPU time has been investigated. Randomly generated examples are used for illustration and comparison.

At the same time, the emergence of an increasingly large number of application areas and the evolution of the networking technology suggest that in the near future the Internet may become the single integrated communication infrastructure. However, as the dependence on the networking infrastructure grows, its security becomes a major concern, in light of the increased attempt to compromise the infrastructure. In particular, the routing operation is a highly visible target that must be shielded against a wide range of attacks. The injection of false routing information can easily degrade network performance, or even cause denial of service for a large number of hosts and networks over a long period of time. Different approaches have been proposed to secure the routing protocols, with a variety of countermeasures, which, nonetheless, have not eradicated the vulnerability of the routing infrastructure.

730,Multi-hour design of survivable classical IP networks,"Most of Internet intra-domain routing protocols (OSPF, RIP, and IS-IS) are based on shortest path routing. The path length is defined as the sum of metrics associated with the path links. These metrics are often managed by the network administrator. In this context, the design of an Internet backbone network consists in dimensioning the network (routers and transmission links) and establishing the metric. Many requirements have to be satisfied. First, Internet traffic is not static as significant variations can be observed during the day. Second, many failures can occur (cable cuts, hardware failures, software failures, etc.). We present algorithms (meta-heuristics and greedy heuristic) to design Internet backbone networks, taking into account the multi-hour behaviour of traffic and some survivability requirements. Many multi-hour and protection strategies are studied and numerically compared.

With this in mind, a process-aware computer aided design (CAD) system called WebCAD has been developed.

9,Achieving competitive capabilities in e-services,"What implications does the Internet have for service operations strategy? How can business performance of e-service companies be improved in today's knowledge-based economy? These research questions are the subject of the paper. We propose a model that links the e-service company's knowledge-based competencies with their competitive capabilities. Drawing from the current literature, our analysis suggests that services that strategically build a portfolio of knowledge-based competencies, namely human capital, structural capital, and absorptive capacity have more operations-based options, than their counterparts who are less apt to invest. We assume that the combinative capabilities of service quality, delivery, flexibility, and cost are determined by the investment in intellectual capital. Arguably, with the advent of the Internet, different operating models (e.g., bricks-and-mortar, clicks-and-mortar, or pure dot-com) have different strategic imperatives in terms of knowledge-based competencies.

Two experimental methods have been suggested in the past to extract the ploughing (non-cutting) component from the total measured force: (1) the extrapolation approach, and (2) the dwell force technique. This study reports the behavior of zinc during orthogonal machining using tools of controlled edge radius. Applications of both the extrapolation and dwell approaches show that neither produces an analysis that yields a material response consistent with the known behavior of zinc. Further analysis shows that the edge geometry modifies the shear zone of the material and thereby modifies the forces.

1285,On fractal dimension in information systems. Toward exact sets in infinite information systems,"The notions of an exact as well as a rough set are well-grounded as basic notions in rough set theory. They are however defined in the setting of a finite information system i.e. an information system having finite numbers of objects as well as attributes. In theoretical studies e.g. of topological properties of rough sets, one has to trespass this limitation and to consider information systems with potentially unbound number of attributes. In such setting, the notions of rough and exact sets may be defined in terms of topological operators of interior and closure with respect to an appropriate topology following the ideas from the finite case, where it is noticed that in the finite case rough-set-theoretic operators of lower and upper approximation are identical with the interior, respectively, closure operators in topology induced by equivalence classes of the indiscernibility relation. Extensions of finite information systems are also desirable from application point of view in the area of knowledge discovery and data mining, when demands of e.g. mass collaboration and/or huge experimental data call for need of working with large data tables so the sound theoretical generalization of these cases is an information system with the number of attributes not bound in advance by a fixed integer i.e. an information system with countably but infinitely many attributes, In large information systems, a need arises for qualitative measures of complexity of concepts involved free of parameters, cf. e.g. applications for the Vapnik-Czervonenkis dimension.

This function is defined as the product of the theoretical coding gain and an index called the peak-to-peak ratio, which was shown to have high correlation with perceptual quality. A distinctive feature of the proposed technique is a procedure by which, given a ""good"" starting filter, ""good"" filters of longer lengths are generated.

In this era of global resource sharing, exchange of bibliographic records from one system to another is imperative in today's library communities. Instead of using a single standard to create machine-readable catalogue records, more than 20 standards have emerged and are being used by different institutions. Because of these variations in standards, sharing of resources and transfer of data from one system to another among the institutions locally and globally has become a significant problem. Addressing this problem requires keeping in mind that countries such as India and others in southeast Asia are using the CCF as a standard for creating bibliographic cataloguing records. This paper describes a way to map the bibliographic catalogue records from CCF to MARC21, although 100% mapping is not possible.

1144,Simultaneous iterative reconstruction of emission and attenuation images in positron emission tomography from emission data only,"For quantitative image reconstruction in positron emission tomography attenuation correction is mandatory. In case that no data are available for the calculation of the attenuation correction factors one can try to determine them from the emission data alone. However, it is not clear if the information content is sufficient to yield an adequate attenuation correction together with a satisfactory activity distribution. Therefore, we determined the log likelihood distribution for a thorax phantom depending on the choice of attenuation and activity pixel values to measure the crosstalk between both. In addition an iterative image reconstruction (one-dimensional Newton-type algorithm with a maximum likelihood estimator), which simultaneously reconstructs the images of the activity distribution and the attenuation coefficients is used to demonstrate the problems and possibilities of such a reconstruction. As result we show that for a change of the log likelihood in the range of statistical noise, the associated change in the activity value of a structure is between 6% and 263%. In addition, we show that it is not possible to choose the best maximum on the basis of the log likelihood when a regularization is used, because the coupling between different structures mediated by the (smoothing) regularization prevents an adequate solution due to crosstalk. We conclude that taking into account the attenuation information in the emission data improves the performance of image reconstruction with respect to the bias of the activities, however, the reconstruction still is not quantitative","['image reconstruction', 'positron emission tomography attenuation correction', 'attenuation correction factors', 'activity distribution', 'log likelihood distribution', 'thorax phantom', 'activity pixel values', 'crosstalk', 'iterative image reconstruction', 'one-dimensional Newton-type algorithm', 'maximum likelihood estimator', 'attenuation coefficients', 'statistical noise', 'smoothing', 'attenuation information']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P']",

Given a set of 2D free-form bins and a set of 2D free-form items, the 2D-FBP problem is to lay out items inside one or more bins in such a way that the number of bins used is minimized, and for each bin, the yield is maximized. The proposed algorithm handles the problem as a variant of the 1D problem; i.e., items and bins are approximated as sets of scanlines, and scanlines are packed. The details of the algorithm are given, and its application to a nesting problem in a shipbuilding company is reported. The proposed algorithm consists of the basic and the group placement algorithms. The basic placement algorithm is a variant of the first-fit decreasing algorithm which is simply extended from the 1D case to the 2D case by a novel scanline approximation. A numerical study with real instances shows that the basic placement algorithm has sufficient performance for most of the instances, however, the group placement algorithm is required when items must be aligned in columns. The qualities of the resulting layouts are good enough for practical use, and the processing times are good","['scanline-based algorithm', '2D free-form bin packing problem', 'heuristic algorithm', '2D-FBP problem', 'minimization', 'nesting problem', 'shipbuilding company', 'group placement algorithm', 'first-fit decreasing algorithm', 'irregular cutting', 'irregular packing', 'yield maximization']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'U', 'M', 'R']",

Rapidly approaching now is the trend for next-generation CMMs. However, the increases in measuring velocity of CMM applications are limited by dynamic errors that occur in CMMs. In this paper a systematic approach for modeling the dynamic errors of a touch-trigger probe CMM is developed through theoretical analysis and experimental study. An overall analysis of the dynamic errors of CMMs is conducted, with weak components of the CMM identified by a laser interferometer. The probing process, as conducted with a touch-trigger probe, is analyzed. The dynamic errors are measured, modeled, and predicted using neural networks. The results indicate that, using this mode, it is possible to compensate for the dynamic errors of CMMs","['compensation', 'dynamic errors', 'coordinate measuring machines', 'manufacturing industry', 'touch-trigger probe', 'laser interferometer', 'neural networks', 'inertial forces']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'U']",

Numerical analysis indicates that for n/k >or= 3, approximation accuracy of the SFA is to the fourth decimal place for most small values of k. This is a substantial improvement on the accuracy that is achievable using the normal, ordinary chi-square, and Scheffe-Tukey approximations.

671,Expert advice - how can my organisation take advantage of reverse auctions without jeopardising existing supplier relationships?,"In a recent survey, AMR Research found that companies that use reverse auctions to negotiate prices with suppliers typically achieve savings of between 10% and 15% on direct goods and between 20% and 25% on indirect goods, and can slash sourcing cycle times from months to weeks. Suppliers, however, are less enthusiastic. They believe that these savings are achieved only by stripping the human element out of negotiations and evaluating bids on price alone, which drives down their profit margins. As a result, reverse auctions carry the risk of jeopardising long-term and trusted relationships. Suppliers that have not been involved in a reverse auction before typically fear the bidding event itself - arguably the most theatrical and, therefore, most hyped-up part of the process.

1224,Formalization of weighted factors analysis,"Weighted factors analysis (WeFA) has been proposed as a new approach for elicitation, representation, and manipulation of knowledge about a given problem, generally at a high and strategic level. Central to this proposal is that a group of experts in the area of the problem can identify a hierarchy of factors with positive or negative influences on the problem outcome. The tangible output of WeFA is a directed weighted graph called a WeFA graph. This is a set of nodes denoting factors that can directly or indirectly influence an overall aim of the graph. The aim is also represented by a node. Each directed arc is a direct influence of one factor on another. A chain of directed arcs indicates an indirect influence. The influences may be identified as either positive or negative. For example, sales and costs are two factors that influence the aim of profitability in an organization. Sales has a positive influence on profitability and costs has a negative influence on profitability. In addition, the relative significance of each influence is represented by a weight. We develop Binary WeFA which is a variant of WeFA where the factors in the graph are restricted to being either true or false. Imposing this restriction on a WeFA graph allows us to be more precise about the meaning of the graph and of reasoning in it. Binary WeFA is a new proposal that provides a formal yet sufficiently simple language for logic-based argumentation for use by business people in decision-support and knowledge management. Whilst Binary WeFA is expressively simpler than other logic-based argumentation formalisms, it does incorporate a novel formalization of the notion of significance","['weighted factors analysis', 'directed weighted graph', 'WeFA graph', 'directed arc', 'profitability', 'organization', 'significance', 'Binary WeFA', 'reasoning', 'logic-based argumentation', 'decision-support', 'knowledge management', 'knowledge elicitation', 'knowledge representation', 'knowledge manipulation']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'R', 'R']",

However, those methods are computationally inefficient due to repeated distance transformations and increased dimensions. In the paper, we propose a new method of modeling fast objects of arbitrary topology by using a surface evolution approach based on mathematical morphology. Given sensor data covering the whole object surface, the method begins with an initial approximation of the object by evolving a closed surface into a model topologically equivalent to the real object. The refined approximation is then performed using energy minimization.

1381,An augmented spatial digital tree algorithm for contact detection in computational mechanics,"Based on the understanding of existing spatial digital tree-based contact detection approaches, and the alternating digital tree (ADT) algorithm in particular, a more efficient algorithm, termed the augmented spatial digital tree (ASDT) algorithm, is proposed in the present work. The ASDT algorithm adopts a different point representation scheme that uses only the lower comer vertex to represent a (hyper-)rectangle, with the upper comer vertex serving as the augmented information. Consequently, the ASDT algorithm can keep the working space the same as the original n-dimensional space and, in general, a much better balanced tree can be expected. This, together with the introduction of an additional bounding subregion for the rectangles associated with each tree node, makes it possible to significantly reduce the number of node visits in the region search, although each node visit may be slightly more expensive. Three examples arising in computational mechanics are presented to provide an assessment of the performance of the ASDT. The numerical results indicate that the ASDT is, at least, over 3.9 times faster than the ADT","['augmented spatial digital tree algorithm', 'contact detection', 'computational mechanics', 'upper comer vertex', 'alternating digital tree algorithm', 'augmented data structure', 'spatial binary tree-based contact detection approaches']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'M', 'M']",

Steady-state behaviour of the system with m cyclic processes utilising a resource with the mutual exclusion is considered.

It was shown that if the conditions hold then the m-process system is marginally stable, i.e., a steady-state of the system depends on the perturbations. The problem of finding the relative positions of the processes leading to waiting-free (maximal efficiency) steady-states of the system is formulated as a constraint logic programming problem. An example illustrating the solving of the problem for a 3-process system using object-oriented, constraint logic programming language Oz is presented. A condition sufficient for strong stability of the m-process system is given.

However, there still remains a gap between the current ability of parallelizing compilers and their final goals. In order to achieve the maximum parallelism, run-time techniques were used in parallelizing compilers during last few years. First, this paper presents a basic run-time privatization method. The definition of run-time dead code is given and its side effect is discussed. To eliminate the imprecision caused by the run-time dead code, backward data-flow information must be used. Proteus Test, which can use backward information in run-time, is then presented to exploit more dynamic parallelism. Also, a variation of Proteus Test, the Advanced Proteus Test, is offered to achieve partial parallelism. Proteus Test was implemented on the parallelizing compiler AFT. In the end of this paper the program fpppp.f of Spec95fp Benchmark is taken as an example, to show the effectiveness of Proteus Test","['parallelizing compilers', 'run-time privatization method', 'run-time dead code', 'backward data-flow information', 'Proteus Test', 'dynamic parallelism', 'run-time data flow analysis']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'M']",

1306,Scalable hybrid computation with spikes,"We outline a hybrid analog-digital scheme for computing with three important features that enable it to scale to systems of large complexity: First, like digital computation, which uses several one-bit precise logical units to collectively compute a precise answer to a computation, the hybrid scheme uses several moderate-precision analog units to collectively compute a precise answer to a computation. Second, frequent discrete signal restoration of the analog information prevents analog noise and offset from degrading the computation. Third, a state machine enables complex computations to be created using a sequence of elementary computations. A natural choice for implementing this hybrid scheme is one based on spikes because spike-count codes are digital, while spike-time codes are analog. We illustrate how spikes afford easy ways to implement all three components of scalable hybrid computation. First, as an important example of distributed analog computation, we show how spikes can create a distributed modular representation of an analog number by implementing digital carry interactions between spiking analog neurons. Second, we show how signal restoration may be performed by recursive spike-count quantization of spike-time codes. Third, we use spikes from an analog dynamical system to trigger state transitions in a digital dynamical system, which reconfigures the analog dynamical system using a binary control vector; such feedback interactions between analog and digital dynamical systems create a hybrid state machine (HSM). The HSM extends and expands the concept of a digital finite-state-machine to the hybrid domain. We present experimental data from a two-neuron HSM on a chip that implements error-correcting analog-to-digital conversion with the concurrent use of spike-time and spike-count codes. We also present experimental data from silicon circuits that implement HSM-based pattern recognition using spike-time synchrony.

Here, a necessary and sufficient condition conjectured in the literature is proved. The real structured singular value which can exploit realness of the controller gain is used to describe computable conditions for DIC. The primary usage of DIC is to eliminate unworkable pairings.

This shows that while there are some factors which seem to be largely specific to CSCW introductions, many of the case study results are very similar to standard IS findings.

We achieve a filtering section with a maximum delay of one by simplifying a pre-upsampled and a post-downsampled FIR filter using the concept of classification of coefficients. This reduction is independent of the order of the filter, which is an advantage when the order of the filter is very large, and as a result the method can also be applied to infinite impulse response (IIR) filters. Furthermore, when the proposed method is compared with the transpose ADF, which has a filtering section with zero delay, it is realized that it significantly reduces the maximum delay associated with updating the coefficients of FIR ADF. The effect of this is that, the proposed method exhibits a higher convergence speed in comparison to the transpose FIR ADF","['pipelined FIR ADF', 'adaptive digital filter', 'maximum delay', 'convergence speed', 'coefficient classification', 'delayed least mean square filter', 'pre-upsampled filter', 'post-downsampled filter']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'R']",

IEEE INFOCOM, San Francisco, CA, , p.996-1003, Mar. 1998)ameliorating the problems associated with large Internet group management protocol (IGMP) leave latencies and abrupt rate increases. Like RLC, FLID-DL, is a scalable, receiver-driven congestion control mechanism in which receivers add layers at sender-initiated synchronization points and leave layers when they experience congestion. FLID-DL congestion control coexists with transmission control protocol (TCP) flows as well as other FLID-DL sessions and supports general rates on the different multicast layers. We demonstrate via simulations that our congestion control scheme exhibits better fairness properties and provides better throughput than previous methods. A key contribution that enables FLID-DL and may be useful elsewhere is dynamic layering (DL), which mitigates the negative impact of long IGMP leave latencies and eliminates the need for probe intervals present in RLC.

Here, we follow the opposite approach: We identify the limit value of a repeated game in discrete time as the value of a differential game. Namely, we use the recursive structure for the finitely repeated version of the dual game to construct a differential game for which the upper values of the uniform discretization satisfy precisely the same property. The value of the dual differential game exists and is the unique viscosity solution of a first-order derivative equation with a limit condition.

A common problem of existing broadcast approaches is the lack of knowledge for a client to determine if all data items satisfying its query could be obtained from the broadcast. We therefore propose a semantic-based broadcast approach. A semantic descriptor is attached to each broadcast unit, called a data chunk. This semantic descriptor allows a client to determine if a query can be answered entirely based on broadcast items and, if needed, identify the precise definition of the remaining items in the form of a ""supplementary"" query. Data chunks can be of static or dynamic sizes and organized hierarchically. Their boundary can be determined on-the-fly, adaptive to the nature of client queries. We investigate different ways of organizing the data chunks over a broadcast channel to improve access performance.

They have been successfully used for solving linear BVPs together with a mesh selection strategy based on the conditioning of the linear systems. Our aim is to extend this approach so as to use them for the numerical approximation of nonlinear problems. For this reason, we consider the quasi-linearization technique that is an application of the Newton method to the nonlinear differential equation. Consequently, each iteration requires the solution of a linear BVP. In order to guarantee the convergence to the solution of the continuous nonlinear problem, it is necessary to determine how accurately the linear BVPs must be solved. For this goal, suitable stopping criteria on the residual and on the error for each linear BVP are given. Numerical experiments on stiff problems give rather satisfactory results, showing that the experimental code, called TOM, that uses a class of BVMs and the quasi-linearization technique, may be competitive with well known solvers for BVPs","['numerical approximation', 'BVMs', 'boundary value methods', 'nonlinear boundary value problems', 'mesh selection strategy', 'quasi-linearization technique', 'Newton method', 'nonlinear differential equation', 'stopping criteria', 'stiff problems']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P']",

90,LAN-based building maintenance and surveillance robot,"The building and construction industry is the major industry of Hong Kong as in many developed countries around the world. After the commissioning of a high-rise building or a large estate, substantial manpower, both inside the management centre under a standby manner, as well as surveillance for security purposes around the whole building, is required for daily operation to ensure a quality environment for the occupants. If the surveillance job can be done by robots, the efficiency can be highly enhanced, resulting in a great saving of manpower and the improved safety of the management staff as a by-product. Furthermore, if the robot can retrieve commands from the building management system via a local area network (LAN), further savings in manpower can be achieved in terms of first-line fault attendance by human management staff. This paper describes the development of a robot prototype here in Hong Kong, which can handle some daily routine maintenance works and surveillance responsibilities. The hardware structure of the robot and its on-board devices are described. Real-time images captured by a camera on the robot with pan/tilt/zoom functions can be transmitted back to the central management office via a local area network. The interface between the robot and the building automation system (BAS) of the building is discussed. This is the first key achievement of this project with a strong implication on reducing the number of human staff to manage a modem building.

It accounts explicitly for spatially varying architecture, ordered cortical maps (such as orientation preference) that vary regularly across the cortical layer, and disordered cortical maps (such as spatial phase preference or stochastic input conductances) that may vary widely from cortical neuron to cortical neuron. The result of the reduction is a set of nonlinear spatiotemporal integral equations for ""phase-averaged"" firing rates of neuronal subpopulations across the model cortex, derived asymptotically from the full model without the addition of any extra phenomological constants. This reduced system is used to study the response of the model to drifting grating stimuli - where it is shown to be useful for numerical investigations that reproduce, at far less computational cost, the salient features of the point-neuron network and for analytical investigations that unveil cortical mechanisms behind the responses observed in the simulations of the large-scale computational model. For example, the reduced equations clearly show (1) phase averaging as the source of the time-invariance of cortico-cortical conductances, (2) the mechanisms in the model for higher firing rates and better orientation selectivity of simple cells which are near pinwheel centers, (3) the effects of the length-scales of cortico-cortical coupling, and (4) the role of noise in improving the contrast invariance of orientation selectivity","['coarse-graining', 'large-scale network model', 'visual cortex', 'nonlinear spatiotemporal integral equations', 'point-neuron network', 'orientation selectivity', 'neuronal networks', 'phase-averaged firing rates', 'dynamics']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'R', 'U']",

Breast tissue model and image acquisition simulation,A method is proposed for generating synthetic mammograms based upon simulations of breast tissue and the mammographic imaging process. A computer breast model has been designed with a realistic distribution of large and medium scale tissue structures. Parameters controlling the size and placement of simulated structures (adipose compartments and ducts) provide a method for consistently modeling images of the same simulated breast with modified position or acquisition parameters. The mammographic imaging process is simulated using a compression model and a model of the X-ray image acquisition process.

It is shown that exact and stable reconstruction of a given region-of-interest in the object does not require all lines passing through the object to be measured. Complete (non-truncated) fan-beam projections provide sufficient information for reconstruction when 'every line passing through the region-of-interest intersects the vertex path in a non-tangential way'.

The power rating of the converter is reduced compared with the pure active filters to filter the harmonic currents.

While the pressure is on to generate income from existing customers and users, portal operators must reach new markets and find realistic revenue streams. This search for real revenues has led to a move towards charging for content, a strategy being pursued by a large number of horizontal portal players, including MSN and Terra Lycos. This trend is particularly noticeable in China, where Chinadotcom operates a mainland portal and plans a range of fee-based services, including electronic mail. The nature of advertising itself is changing, with portals seeking blue-chip sponsorship and marketing deals that span a number of years. Players are struggling to redefine and reinvent themselves as a result of the changing environment and even the term ""portal"" is believed to be obsolete, partly due to its dot.com crash associations.

861,The decision procedure for profitability of investment projects using the internal rate of return of single-period projects,"The internal rate of return (IRR) criterion is often used to evaluate profitability of investment projects. In this paper, we focus on a single-period project which consists of two types of cash flows; an investment at one period and a return at a succeeding period, and a financing at one period and a repayment at a succeeding period. We decompose the given investment project into a series of the single-period projects. From the viewpoint of the single-period project, we point out the applicability issue of the IRR criterion, namely the IRR criterion cannot be applied in which a project is composed of both investment type and financing type. Investigating the properties of a series of the single-period projects, we resolve the applicability issue of the IRR criterion and propose the decision procedure for profitability judgment toward any type of investment project based on the comparison between the IRR and the capital cost. We develop a new algorithm to obtain the value of the project investment rate (PIR) for the given project, which is a function of the capital cost, only using the standard IRR computing routine.

If a reasonable amount of data is available, the ANN can ""understand"" the problem and provide the genetic algorithm with a selected population of elements that will speed up the search for the optimum solution. We tested the method in a search for the ground-state geometry of silicon clusters. We trained the ANN with information about the geometry and energetics of small silicon clusters. Next, the ANN learned how to restrict the configurational space for larger silicon clusters. For Si/sub 10/ and Si/sub 20/, we noticed that the NAGA is at least three times faster than the ""pure"" genetic algorithm.

732,A unifying co-operative Web caching architecture,"Network caching of objects has become a standard way of reducing network traffic and latency in the Web. However, Web caches exhibit poor performance with a hit rate of about 30%. A solution to improve this hit rate is to have a group of proxies form co-operation where objects can be cached for later retrieval. A cooperative cache system includes protocols for hierarchical and transversal caching. The drawback of such a system lies in the resulting network load due to the number of messages that need to be exchanged to locate an object. This paper proposes a new co-operative Web caching architecture, which unifies previous methods of Web caching. Performance results shows that the architecture achieve up to 70% co-operative hit rate and accesses the cached object in at most two hops. Moreover, the architecture is scalable with low traffic and database overhead","['co-operative Web caching architecture', 'network caching', 'cooperative cache system', 'protocols', 'transversal caching', 'network load', 'co-operative hit rate', 'network traffic reduction', 'network latency reduction', 'hierarchical caching', 'scalable architecture', 'low traffic overhead', 'low database overhead', 'Web browser', 'World Wide Web']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'M', 'M', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'M', 'M']",

It is particularly well suited to be used in distributed computer-controlled systems where a set of process variables must be shared among network devices. To cope with the real-time requirements of such systems, the protocol provides communication services based on the exchange of periodic and aperiodic identified variables. The periodic exchanges have the highest priority and are executed at run time according to a cyclic schedule. Therefore, the respective schedulability can be determined at pre-run-time when building the schedule table. Concerning the aperiodic exchanges, the situation is different since their priority is lower and they are bandied according to a first-come-first-served policy. In this paper, a response-time-based schedulability analysis for the real-time traffic is presented. Such analysis considers both types of traffic in an integrated way, according to their priorities. Furthermore, a fixed-priorities-based policy is also used to schedule the periodic traffic. The proposed analysis represents an improvement relative to previous work and it can be evaluated online as part of a traffic online admission control.

1301,Integrate-and-fire neurons driven by correlated stochastic input,"Neurons are sensitive to correlations among synaptic inputs. However, analytical models that explicitly include correlations are hard to solve analytically, so their influence on a neuron's response has been difficult to ascertain. To gain some intuition on this problem, we studied the firing times of two simple integrate-and-fire model neurons driven by a correlated binary variable that represents the total input current. Analytic expressions were obtained for the average firing rate and coefficient of variation (a measure of spike-train variability) as functions of the mean, variance, and correlation time of the stochastic input. The results of computer simulations were in excellent agreement with these expressions. In these models, an increase in correlation time in general produces an increase in both the average firing rate and the variability of the output spike trains. However, the magnitude of the changes depends differentially on the relative values of the input mean and variance: the increase in firing rate is higher when the variance is large relative to the mean, whereas the increase in variability is higher when the variance is relatively small. In addition, the firing rate always tends to a finite limit value as the correlation time increases toward infinity, whereas the coefficient of variation typically diverges. These results suggest that temporal correlations may play a major role in determining the variability as well as the intensity of neuronal spike trains","['integrate-and-fire neurons', 'correlated stochastic input', 'firing times', 'correlated binary variable', 'coefficient of variation', 'spike-train variability', 'computer simulation', 'output spike trains', 'temporal correlations', 'synaptic input correlations']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R']",

This facilitates the identification of the foreground and interfering strokes.

Instead, universality is best explained by classical symbol systems, with connectionism as its implementation. Here it is argued that universality is also a problem for classicism in that the syntax-sensitive rules that are supposed to provide causal explanations of mental processes are either too strict, precluding possible generalizations; or too lax, providing no information as to the appropriate alternative.

962,Optimal control using the transport equation: the Liouville machine,"Transport theory describes the scattering behavior of physical particles such as photons. Here we show how to connect this theory to optimal control theory and to adaptive behavior of agents embedded in an environment. Environments and tasks are defined by physical boundary conditions. Given some task, we compute a set of probability densities on continuous state and action and time. From these densities we derive an optimal policy such that for all states the most likely action maximizes the probability of reaching a predefined goal state. Liouville's conservation theorem tells us that the conditional density at time t, state s, and action a must equal the density at t + dt, s + ds, a + da.

73,How does attitude impact IT implementation: a study of small business owners,"According to previous studies, attitude towards information technology (IT) among small business owners appears to be a key factor in achieving high quality IT implementations. In an effort to extend this stream of research, we conducted case studies with small business owners and learned that high quality IT implementations resulted with owners who had positive or negative attitudes toward IT, but not with owners who had uncertain attitudes. Owners with apolar attitude, either positive or negative, all took action to temper the uncertainty and risk surrounding the use of new IT in their organization. In contrast, owners with uncertain attitudes did not make mitigating attempts to reduce uncertainty and risk. A consistent finding among those with high quality IT implementations was an entrepreneurial, or shared, management style. It is proposed, based on case study data, that small business owners with an uncertain attitude towards IT might experience higher quality IT results in their organizations through practicing a more entrepreneurial, or shared, management style. The study provides insights for both computer specialists and small business owners planning IT implementations","['small business owners', 'negative attitudes', 'uncertain attitude', 'risk', 'organization', 'management style', 'computer specialists', 'planning', 'information technology implementation', 'positive attitudes']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'R']",

When a rule needed for solving the problem does not exist, the problem can be solved by using rules similar to the existing rules. In an implementation using the SLD procedure, a resolution is executed between a subgoal and a rule if an atom of the subgoal is similar to the consequence atom of the rule. Similarities between atoms are calculated using a knowledge base of words with account of the reasoning situation, and the reliability of the derived solution is calculated based on these similarities. If many solutions are obtained, they are grouped into classes of similar solutions and a representative solution is then selected for each class. The proposed method was verified experimentally by solving simple problems","['approximate solution', 'incomplete knowledge', 'rule similarity', 'inference method', 'SLD procedure', 'consequence atom', 'reasoning', 'reliability', 'representative solution', 'problem solving', 'subgoal atom', 'word knowledge base', 'common sense knowledge']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'M']",

The proposed COG defuzzifier is specified by various design parameters such as the centers, widths, and modifiers of MFs. The design parameters are adjusted with the Lamarckian co-adaptation of learning and evolution, where the learning performs a local search of design parameters in an individual COG defuzzifier, but the evolution performs a global search of design parameters among a population of various COG defuzzifiers. This co-adaptation scheme allows to evolve much faster than the non-learning case and gives a higher possibility of finding an optimal solution due to its wider searching capability. An application to the truck backer-upper control problem of the proposed co-adaptive design method of COG defuzzifier is presented.

Then, lines that intersect at one point are fitted to the edges in a Hough space. Consequently, the vanishing point is estimated robustly even when the lane markings are occluded by other vehicles.

1120,An effective feedback control mechanism for DiffServ architecture,"As a scalable QoS (Quality of Service) architecture, Diffserv (Differentiated Service) mainly consists of two components: traffic conditioning at the edge of the Diffserv domain and simple packet forwarding inside the DiffServ domain. DiffServ has many advantages such as flexibility, scalability and simplicity. But when providing AF (Assured Forwarding) services, DiffServ has some problems such as unfairness among aggregated flows or among micro-flows belonging to an aggregated flow. In this paper, a feedback mechanism for AF aggregated flows is proposed to solve this problem. Simulation results show that this mechanism does improve the performance of DiffServ. First, it can improve the fairness among aggregated flows and make DiffServ more friendly toward TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) flows. Second, it can decrease the buffer requirements at the congested router and thus obtain lower delay and packet loss rate. Third, it also keeps almost the same link utility as in normal DiffServ.

The application domain of data broadcast will be widely expanded in the near future, where the client is expected to perform complex queries or transactions on the broadcast data. To reduce the access latency for processing the complex query, it is beneficial to place the data accessed in a query close to each other on the broadcast channel.

769,"Permission grids: practical, error-bounded simplification","We introduce the permission grid, a spatial occupancy grid which can be used to guide almost any standard polygonal surface simplification algorithm into generating an approximation with a guaranteed geometric error bound. In particular, all points on the approximation are guaranteed to be within some user-specified distance from the original surface. Such bounds are notably absent from many current simplification methods, and are becoming increasingly important for applications in scientific computing and adaptive level of detail control. Conceptually simple, the permission grid defines a volume in which the approximation must lie, and does not permit the underlying simplification algorithm to generate approximations outside the volume. The permission grid makes three important, practical improvements over current error-bounded simplification methods. First, it works on arbitrary triangular models, handling all manners of mesh degeneracies gracefully. Further, the error tolerance may be easily expanded as simplification proceeds, allowing the construction of an error-bounded level of detail hierarchy with vertex correspondences among all levels of detail. And finally, the permission grid has a representation complexity independent of the size of the input model, and a small running time overhead, making it more practical and efficient than current methods with similar guarantees","['permission grid', 'error-bounded simplification', 'spatial occupancy grid', 'polygonal surface simplification algorithm', 'approximation', 'guaranteed geometric error bound', 'user-specified distance', 'scientific computing', 'adaptive level of detail control', 'arbitrary triangular models', 'mesh degeneracies', 'error tolerance', 'vertex correspondences', 'representation complexity', 'running time overhead']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P']",

We introduce a number of variants to this basic key-lock technique. Polymorphic access rights make it possible to decrease the number of keys required to certify possession of complex access privileges that are defined in terms of several access rights. Multiple locks on the same access right allow us to exercise forms of selective revocation of access privileges.

1141,Reproducibility of mammary gland structure during repeat setups in a supine position,"Purpose: In breast conserving therapy, complete excision of the tumor with an acceptable cosmetic outcome depends on accurate localization in terms of both the position of the lesion and its extent. We hypothesize that preoperative contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the patient in a supine position may be used for accurate tumor localization and marking of its extent immediately prior to surgery. Our aims in this study are to assess the reproducibility of mammary gland structure during repeat setups in a supine position, to evaluate the effect of a breast immobilization device, and to derive reproducibility margins that take internal tissue shifts into account occurring between repeat setups. Materials Methods: The reproducibility of mammary gland structure during repeat setups in a supine position is estimated by quantification of tissue shifts in the breasts of healthy volunteers between repeat MR setups. For each volunteer fiducials are identified and registered with their counter locations in corresponding MR volumes. The difference in position denotes the shift of breast tissue. The dependence on breast volume and the part of the breast, as well as the effect of a breast immobilization cast are studied. Results: The tissue shifts are small with a mean standard deviation on the order of 1.5 mm, being slightly larger in large breasts (V>1000 cm/sup 3/), and in the posterior part (toward the pectoral muscle) of both small and large breasts. The application of a breast immobilization cast reduces the tissue shifts in large breasts. A reproducibility margin on the order of 5 mm will take the internal tissue shifts into account that occur between repeat setups.

1205,HPCVIEW: a tool for top-down analysis of node performance,"It is increasingly difficult for complex scientific programs to attain a significant fraction of peak performance on systems that are based on microprocessors with substantial instruction-level parallelism and deep memory hierarchies. Despite this trend, performance analysis and tuning tools are still not used regularly by algorithm and application designers. To a large extent, existing performance tools fail to meet many user needs and are cumbersome to use. To address these issues, we developed HPCVIEW - a toolkit for combining multiple sets of program profile data, correlating the data with source code, and generating a database that can be analyzed anywhere with a commodity Web browser.

138,Optical actuation of a bistable MEMS,"This paper presents an optical actuation scheme for MEMS devices based on the well-established fact that light possesses momentum, and hence, imparts a force equal to 2 W/c when reflected by a surface. Here, W is the total power of the reflected light, and c is the speed of light. Radiation pressure, as it is known, is nearly insignificant for most macroscale applications, but it can be quite significant for MEMS devices. In addition, light actuation offers a new paradigm. First, intersecting light beams do not interfere, in contrast to electrical conductors, which short when they come into contact. Second, light can operate in high temperature and high radiation environments far outside the capability of solid state electronic components. This actuation method is demonstrated, both in air and in vacuum, by switching the state of a bistable MEMS device.

In this paper, by using the notion of an exceptional family of elements we develop a sufficient condition which ensures that the solution set of the P/sub 0/ function NCP is nonempty and bounded. In particular, we prove that many existing assumed conditions imply this sufficient condition. Thus, these conditions imply that the solution set of the P/sub 0/ function NCP is nonempty and bounded.

The evolution of disturbances is analysed in the framework of the parabolized stability equations (PSE). A gradient-based optimization procedure is used and the gradients are evaluated using the adjoint of the parabolized stability equations (APSE) and the adjoint of the boundary layer equations (ABLE). The accuracy of the gradient is increased by introducing a stabilization procedure for the PSE. Results show that a suction peak appears in the upstream part of the suction region for optimal control of Tollmien-Schlichting (T-S) waves, steady streamwise streaks in a two-dimensional boundary layer and oblique waves in a quasi-three-dimensional boundary layer subject to an adverse pressure gradient. The mean flow modifications due to suction are shown to have a stabilizing effect similar to that of a favourable pressure gradient. It is also shown that the optimal suction distribution for the disturbance of interest reduces the growth rate of other perturbations.

It was found that the reactance component of the impedance varied distinctively according to the billet state and could clearly monitor the deformation of the billet, while the resistance component increased with temperature, reflecting the variation of the resistivity of the billet which has strong correlation to the solid/liquid fraction of the billets.

57,Speaker adaptive modeling by vocal tract normalization,"This paper presents methods for speaker adaptive modeling using vocal tract normalization (VTN) along with experimental tests on three databases. We propose a new training method for VTN: By using single-density acoustic models per HMM state for selecting the scale factor of the frequency axis, we avoid the problem that a mixture-density tends to learn the scale factors of the training speakers and thus cannot be used for selecting the scale factor. We show that using single Gaussian densities for selecting the scale factor in training results in lower error rates than using mixture densities. For the recognition phase, we propose an improvement of the well-known two-pass strategy: by using a non-normalized acoustic model for the first recognition pass instead of a normalized model, lower error rates are obtained. In recognition tests, this method is compared with a fast variant of VTN. The two-pass strategy is an efficient method, but it is suboptimal because the scale factor and the word sequence are determined sequentially. We found that for telephone digit string recognition this suboptimality reduces the VTN gain in recognition performance by 30% relative.

The contrast between the two processes of technical change prove remarkable, despite both processes being essentially confined to learning.

To reduce this high number of biopsies performed on benign lesions, a case-based reasoning (CBR) classifier was developed to predict biopsy results from BI-RADS/sup TM/ findings. We used 1433 (931 benign) biopsy-proven mammographic cases. CBR similarity was defined using either the Hamming or Euclidean distance measure over case features. Ten features represented each case: calcification distribution, calcification morphology, calcification number, mass margin, mass shape, mass density, mass size, associated findings, special cases, and age. Performance was evaluated using Round Robin sampling, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis, and bootstrap. To determine the most influential features for the CBR, an exhaustive feature search was performed over all possible feature combinations (1022) and similarity thresholds. Influential features were defined as the most frequently occurring features in the feature subsets with the highest partial ROC areas (/sub 0.90/AUC). For CBR with Hamming distance, the most influential features were found to be mass margin, calcification morphology, age, calcification distribution, calcification number, and mass shape, resulting in an /sub 0.90/AUC of 0.33. At 95% sensitivity, the Hamming CBR would spare from biopsy 34% of the benign lesions. At 98% sensitivity, the Hamming CBR would spare 27% benign lesions. For the CBR with Euclidean distance, the most influential feature subset consisted of mass margin, calcification morphology, age, mass density, and associated findings, resulting in /sub 0.90/AUC of 0.37. At 95% sensitivity, the Euclidean CBR would spare from biopsy 41% benign lesions. At 98% sensitivity, the Euclidean CBR would spare 27% benign lesions.

We develop a new methodology for designing a linear filter such that the error variance of the filter is guaranteed to be within a certain upper bound for any allowed uncertainty and time delay. The solution is given in terms of two Riccati equations. Multiple time-delay systems are also investigated,"['robust Kalman filter', 'discrete time-delay systems', 'state delay', 'norm-bounded parameter uncertainty', 'output matrices', 'linear filter', 'Riccati equations', 'uncertain systems', 'time-varying parameter uncertainty', 'state matrices', 'robust state estimation']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'M']",

1362,Process planning for reliable high-speed machining of moulds,"A method of generating NC programs for the high-speed milling of moulds is investigated. Forging dies and injection moulds, whether plastic or aluminium, have a complex surface geometry. In addition they are made of steels of hardness as much as 30 or even 50 HRC. Since 1995, high-speed machining has been much adopted by the die-making industry, which with this technology can reduce its use of Sinking Electrodischarge Machining (SEDM). EDM, in general, calls for longer machining times. The use of high-speed machining makes it necessary to redefine the preliminary stages of the process. In addition, it affects the methodology employed in the generation of NC programs, which requires the use of high-level CAM software. The aim is to generate error-free programs that make use of optimum cutting strategies in the interest of productivity and surface quality. The final result is a more reliable manufacturing process. There are two risks in the use of high-speed milling on hardened steels. One of these is tool breakage, which may be very costly and may furthermore entail marks on the workpiece. The other is collisions between the tool and the workpiece or fixtures, the result of which may be damage to the ceramic bearings in the spindles. in order to minimize these risks it is necessary that new control and optimization steps be included in the CAM methodology. There are three things that the firm adopting high-speed methods should do. It should redefine its process engineering, it should systematize access by its CAM programmers to high-speed knowhow, and it should take up the use of process simulation tools. In the latter case, it will be very advantageous to use tools for the estimation of cutting forces. The new work methods proposed in this article have made it possible to introduce high speed milling (HSM) into the die industry. Examples are given of how the technique has been applied with CAM programming re-engineered as here proposed, with an explanation of the novel features and the results","['process planning', 'reliable high-speed machining', 'moulds', 'NC programs', 'high-speed milling', 'forging dies', 'injection moulds', 'complex surface geometry', 'error-free programs', 'optimum cutting strategies', 'cutting strategies', 'productivity', 'surface quality', 'hardened steels', 'tool breakage', 'ceramic bearings', 'CAM methodology', 'process simulation tools', 'CAM programming re-engineering', 'tool workpiece collisions', 'process engineering redefinition']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'M']",

772,Meshed atlases for real-time procedural solid texturing,"We describe an implementation of procedural solid texturing that uses the texture atlas, a one-to-one mapping from an object's surface into its texture space. The method uses the graphics hardware to rasterize the solid texture coordinates as colors directly into the atlas. A texturing procedure is applied per-pixel to the texture map, replacing each solid texture coordinate with its corresponding procedural solid texture result. The procedural solid texture is then mapped back onto the object surface using standard texture mapping. The implementation renders procedural solid textures in real time, and the user can design them interactively. The quality of this technique depends greatly on the layout of the texture atlas. A broad survey of texture atlas schemes is used to develop a set of general purpose mesh atlases and tools for measuring their effectiveness at distributing as many available texture samples as evenly across the surface as possible. The main contribution of this paper is a new multiresolution texture atlas. It distributes all available texture samples in a nearly uniform distribution.

1026,Use of SPOT images as a tool for coastal zone management and monitoring of environmental impacts in the coastal zone,"Modern techniques such as remote sensing have been one of the main factors leading toward the achievement of serious plans regarding coastal management. A multitemporal analysis of land use in certain areas of the Colombian Caribbean Coast is described. It mainly focuses on environmental impacts caused by anthropogenic activities, such as deforestation of mangroves due to shrimp farming. Selection of sensitive areas, percentage of destroyed mangroves, possible endangered areas, etc., are some of the results of this analysis. Recommendations for a coastal management plan in the area have also resulted from this analysis. Some other consequences of the deforestation of mangroves in the coastal zone and the construction of shrimp ponds are also analyzed, such as the increase of erosion problems in these areas and water pollution, among others. The increase of erosion in these areas has also changed part of their morphology, which has been studied by the analysis of SPOT images in previous years. A serious concern exists about the future of these areas. For this reason new techniques like satellite images (SPOT) have been applied with good results, leading to more effective control and coastal management in the area.

1063,Operations that do not disturb partially known quantum states,"Consider a situation in which a quantum system is secretly prepared in a state chosen from the known set of states. We present a principle that gives a definite distinction between the operations that preserve the states of the system and those that disturb the states. The principle is derived by alternately applying a fundamental property of classical signals and a fundamental property of quantum ones. The principle can be cast into a simple form by using a decomposition of the relevant Hilbert space, which is uniquely determined by the set of possible states. The decomposition implies the classification of the degrees of freedom of the system into three parts depending on how they store the information on the initially chosen state: one storing it classically, one storing it nonclassically, and the other one storing no information. Then the principle states that the nonclassical part is inaccessible and the classical part is read-only if we are to preserve the state of the system. From this principle, many types of no-cloning, no-broadcasting, and no-imprinting conditions can easily be derived in general forms including mixed states. It also gives a unified view on how various schemes of quantum cryptography work. The principle helps one to derive optimum amount of resources (bits, qubits, and ebits) required in data compression or in quantum teleportation of mixed-state ensembles","['partially known quantum states', 'quantum system', 'classical signals', 'Hilbert space', 'degrees of freedom', 'nonclassical part', 'quantum cryptography', 'bits', 'qubits', 'ebits', 'quantum teleportation', 'mixed-state ensembles', 'secretly prepared quantum state']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R']",

652,A case for end system multicast,"The conventional wisdom has been that Internet protocol (IP) is the natural protocol layer for implementing multicast related functionality. However, more than a decade after its initial proposal, IP multicast is still plagued with concerns pertaining to scalability, network management, deployment, and support for higher layer functionality such as error, flow, and congestion control. We explore an alternative architecture that we term end system multicast, where end systems implement all multicast related functionality including membership management and packet replication. This shifting of multicast support from routers to end systems has the potential to address most problems associated with IP multicast. However, the key concern is the performance penalty associated with such a model. In particular, end system multicast introduces duplicate packets on physical links and incurs larger end-to-end delays than IP multicast. We study these performance concerns in the context of the Narada protocol. In Narada, end systems self-organize into an overlay structure using a fully distributed protocol. Further, end systems attempt to optimize the efficiency of the overlay by adapting to network dynamics and by considering application level performance. We present details of Narada and evaluate it using both simulation and Internet experiments. Our results indicate that the performance penalties are low both from the application and the network perspectives. We believe the potential benefits of transferring multicast functionality from end systems to routers significantly outweigh the performance penalty incurred","['end system multicast', 'Internet protocol', 'protocol layer', 'IP multicast', 'network management', 'higher layer functionality', 'congestion control', 'membership management', 'packet replication', 'performance penalties', 'end-to-end delays', 'Narada protocol', 'overlay structure', 'distributed protocol', 'network dynamics', 'application level performance', 'simulation', 'Internet experiments', 'network scalability', 'network routers', 'self-organizing protocol']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'R', 'R']",

1207,Packet spacing: an enabling mechanism for delivering multimedia content in computational grids,"Streaming multimedia with UDP has become increasingly popular over distributed systems like the Internet. Scientific applications that stream multimedia include remote computational steering of visualization data and video-on-demand teleconferencing over the Access Grid. However, UDP does not possess a self-regulating, congestion-control mechanism; and most best-effort traffic is served by congestion-controlled TCP. Consequently, UDP steals bandwidth from TCP such that TCP flows starve for network resources. With the volume of Internet traffic continuing to increase, the perpetuation of UDP-based streaming will cause the Internet to collapse as it did in the mid-1980's due to the use of non-congestion-controlled TCP. To address this problem, we introduce the counter-intuitive notion of inter-packet spacing with control feedback to enable UDP-based applications to perform well in the next-generation Internet and computational grids. When compared with traditional UDP-based streaming, we illustrate that our approach can reduce packet loss over 50% without adversely affecting delivered throughput","['streaming multimedia', 'UDP', 'distributed systems', 'Internet', 'remote computational steering', 'visualization data', 'UDP-based streaming', 'inter-packet spacing', 'network protocol', 'transport protocols']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'M', 'U']",

984,Bistability of harmonically forced relaxation oscillations,"Relaxation oscillations appear in processes which involve transitions between two states characterized by fast and slow time scales. When a relaxation oscillator is coupled to an external periodic force its entrainment by the force results in a response which can include multiple periodicities and bistability. The prototype of these behaviors is the harmonically driven van der Pol equation which displays regions in the parameter space of the driving force amplitude where stable orbits of periods 2n+or-1 coexist, flanked by regions of periods 2n+1 and 2n-1. The parameter regions of such bistable orbits are derived analytically for the closely related harmonically driven Stoker-Haag piecewise discontinuous equation. The results are valid over most of the control parameter space of the system. Also considered are the reasons for the more complicated dynamics featuring regions of high multiple periodicity which appear like noise between ordered periodic regions. Since this system mimics in detail the less analytically tractable forced van der Pol equation, the results suggest extensions to situations where forced relaxation oscillations are a component of the operating mechanisms","['bistability', 'harmonically forced relaxation oscillations', 'external periodic force', 'entrainment', 'van der Pol equation', 'harmonically driven Stoker-Haag piecewise discontinuous equation', 'control parameter space', 'nonlinear dynamics']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'M']",
1143,A three-source model for the calculation of head scatter factors,"Accurate determination of the head scatter factor S/sub c/ is an important issue, especially for intensity modulated radiation therapy, where the segmented fields are often very irregular and much less than the collimator jaw settings. In this work, we report an S/sub c/ calculation algorithm for symmetric, asymmetric, and irregular open fields shaped by the tertiary collimator (a multileaf collimator or blocks) at different source-to-chamber distance. The algorithm was based on a three-source model, in which the photon radiation to the point of calculation was treated as if it originated from three effective sources: one source for the primary photons from the target and two extra-focal photon sources for the scattered photons from the primary collimator and the flattening filter, respectively. The field mapping method proposed by Kim et al. [Phys. Med. Biol. 43, 1593-1604 (1998)] was extended to two extra-focal source planes and the scatter contributions were integrated over the projected areas (determined by the detector's eye view) in the three source planes considering the source intensity distributions. The algorithm was implemented using Microsoft Visual C/C++ in the MS Windows environment. The only input data required were head scatter factors for symmetric square fields, which are normally acquired during machine commissioning. A large number of different fields were used to evaluate the algorithm and the results were compared with measurements. We found that most of the calculated S/sub c/'s agreed with the measured values to within 0.4%.

We assume that corporate debt can be valued as an option on corporate business asset value, and derive payoff functions when there exist cross-holdings of stock or debt between two firms. Next we show that payoff functions with multiple cross-holdings can be solved by the contraction principle. The payoff functions which we derive provide a number of insights about the risk structure of company cross-holdings. First, the Modigliani-Miller theorem can obtain when there exist cross-holdings between firms. Second, by establishing cross-shareholdings each of stock holders distributes a part of its payoff values to the bond holder of the other's firm, so that both firms can decrease credit risks by cross-shareholdings. In the numerical examples, we show that the correlation in firms can be a critical condition for reducing credit risk by cross-holdings of stock using Monte Carlo simulation.

1167,A new approach to the d-MC problem,"Many real-world systems are multi-state systems composed of multi-state components in which the reliability can be computed in terms of the lower bound points of level d, called d-Mincuts (d-MCs). Such systems (electric power, transportation, etc.) may be regarded as flow networks whose arcs have independent, discrete, limited and multi-valued random capacities. In this paper, all MCs are assumed to be known in advance, and the authors focused on how to verify each d-MC candidate before using d-MCs to calculate the network reliability. The proposed algorithm is more efficient than existing algorithms. The algorithm runs in O(p sigma mn) time, a significant improvement over the previous O(p sigma m/sup 2/) time bounds based on max-flow/min-cut, where p and or are the number of MCs and d-MC candidates, respectively. It is simple, intuitive and uses no complex data structures. An example is given to show how all d-MC candidates are found and verified by the proposed algorithm. Then the reliability of this example is computed","['d-MC problem', 'multi-state systems', 'multi-state components', 'd-Mincuts', 'flow networks', 'time bounds', 'max-flow/min-cut', 'reliability computation', 'failure analysis algorithm']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'M']",
1122,Hybrid broadcast for the video-on-demand service,"Multicast offers an efficient means of distributing video contents/programs to multiple clients by batching their requests and then having them share a server's video stream. Batching customers' requests is either client-initiated or server-initiated. Most advanced client-initiated video multicasts are implemented by patching. Periodic broadcast, a typical server-initiated approach, can be entirety-based or segment-based. This paper focuses on the performance of the VoD service for popular videos. First, we analyze the limitation of conventional patching when the customer request rate is high. Then, by combining the advantages of each of the two broadcast schemes, we propose a hybrid broadcast scheme for popular videos, which not only lowers the service latency but also improves clients' interactivity by using an active buffering technique. This is shown to be a good compromise for both lowering service latency and improving the VCR-like interactivity","['video-on-demand', 'multicast', 'conventional patching', 'customer request rate', 'hybrid broadcast scheme', 'interactivity', 'quality-of-service', 'scheduling']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'U', 'U']",

1266,An intelligent information gathering method for dynamic information mediators,"The Internet is spreading into our society rapidly and is becoming one of the information infrastructures that are indispensable for our daily life. In particular, the WWW is widely used for various purposes such as sharing personal information, academic research, business work, and electronic commerce, and the amount of available information is increasing rapidly. We usually utilize information sources on the Internet as individual stand-alone sources, but if we can integrate them, we can add more value to each of them. Hence, information mediators, which integrate information distributed on the Internet, are drawing attention. In this paper, under the assumption that the information sources to be integrated are updated frequently and asynchronously, we propose an information gathering method that constructs an answer to a query from a user, accessing information sources to be integrated properly within an allowable time period. The proposed method considers the reliability of data in the cache and the quality of answer in order to efficiently access information sources and to provide appropriate answers to the user. As evaluation, we show the effectiveness of the proposed method by using an artificial information integration problem, in which some parameters can be modified, and a real-world flight information service compared with a conventional FIFO information gathering method","['intelligent information gathering method', 'dynamic information mediators', 'Internet', 'information infrastructures', 'WWW', 'academic research', 'business work', 'electronic commerce', 'artificial information integration problem', 'real-world flight information service']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P']",

The main issue is to avoid the view recomputation from scratch especially when views are defined from multiple sources. The data of the data warehouse is used primarily in organizational decision-making and may be strategic.

While such a thesis has been defended by several authors elsewhere, our primary concern here is to take up the issue of the compatibility of selective representing and realism. We hope to show three things. First, that the notion of selective representing is fully consistent with the realist idea of a mind-independent world. Second, that not only are these two consistent, but that the latter (the realist conception of a mind-independent world) provides the most powerful perspective from which to motivate and understand the differing perceptual and cognitive profiles themselves. Third, that the (genuine and important) sense in which organism and environment may together constitute an integrated system of scientific interest poses no additional threat to the realist conception","['selective representing', 'world-making', 'mental representations', 'organisms', 'realism', 'mind-independent world', 'cognitive profiles']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P']",

The scalar fractional-order impulse response is determined, and is a generalization of the exponential function. Stability properties of fractional-order systems are presented in the complex w-plane, which is a transformation of the s-plane. Time responses are discussed with respect to pole positions in the complex w-plane and frequency response behavior is included. A fractional-order vector space representation, which is a generalization of the state space concept, is presented including the initialization response.

Swindale et al. think it is inappropriate to apply the standards of proof required in mathematics to the acceptance or rejection of scientific hypotheses. To give some examples, showing that data are well described by a linear model does not rule out an infinity of other possible models that might give better descriptions of the data. Proving in a mathematical sense that the linear model was correct would require ruling out all other possible models, a hopeless task. Similarly, to demonstrate that two DNA samples come from the same individual, it is sufficient to show a match between only a few regions of the genome, even though there remains a very large number of additional comparisons that could be done, any one of which might potentially disprove the match.

925,A fundamental investigation into large strain recovery of one-way shape memory alloy wires embedded in flexible polyurethanes,"Shape memory alloys (SMAs) are being embedded in or externally attached to smart structures because of the large amount of actuation deformation and force that these materials are capable of producing when they are heated. Previous investigations have focused primarily on using single or opposing SMA wires exhibiting the two-way shape memory effect (SME) because of the simplicity with which the repeatable actuation behavior of the structure can be predicted. This repeatable actuation behavior is achieved at the expense of reduced levels of recoverable deformation. Alternatively, many potential smart structure applications will employ multiple SMA wires exhibiting a permanent one-way SME to simplify fabrication and increase the recoverable strains in the structure. To employ the one-way wires, it is necessary to investigate how they affect the recovery of large strains when they are embedded in a structure. In this investigation, the large strain recovery of a one-way SMA wire embedded in a flexible polyurethane is characterized using the novel deformation measurement technique known as digital image correlation. These results are compared with a simple actuation model and a three-dimensional finite element analysis of the structure using the Brinson model for describing the thermomechanical behavior of the SMA. Results indicate that the level of actuation strain in the structure is substantially reduced by the inelastic behavior of the one-way SMA wires, and there are significant differences between the deformations of the matrix material adjacent to the SMA wires and in the region surrounding it. The transformation behavior of the SMA wires was also determined to be volume preserving, which had a significant effect on the transverse strain fields","['strain recovery', 'one-way shape memory', 'alloy wires', 'flexible polyurethanes', 'flexible polyurethanes', 'smart structures', 'actuation deformation', 'deformations', 'SMA wires', 'two-way shape memory effect', 'recoverable strains', 'three-dimensional finite element analysis', 'actuation strain', 'matrix material', 'transverse strain fields', 'flexible polyurethane', 'embedded sensor']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'M']",

We explore bisimulation minimization as an optimization in symbolic model checking of invariance properties. We consider three bisimulation minimization algorithms. From each, we produce a BDD-based model checker for invariant properties and compare this model checker to a conventional one based on backwards reachability. Our comparisons, both theoretical and experimental, suggest that bisimulation minimization is not viable in the context of invariance verification, because performing the minimization requires as many, if not more, computational resources as model checking the unminimized system through backwards reachability","['bisimulation minimization', 'symbolic model checking', 'state space minimization techniques', 'state explosion', 'explicit-state verification tools', 'experimental results', 'optimization', 'invariance properties', 'backwards reachability', 'invariance verification', 'BDD', 'binary decision diagram']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'U', 'U']",

Our analysis first undertakes fusion of possible loop nests intra-procedurally and then performs loop distribution. The analysis discovers the closeness factor of two statements which is a quantitative measure of data traffic saved per unit memory occupied if the statements were under the same loop nest over the case where they are under different loop nests. We then develop a greedy algorithm which traverses the program dependence graph to group statements together under the same loop nest legally to promote maximal reuse per unit of memory occupied. We implemented our framework in Petit, a tool for dependence analysis and loop transformations. We compared our method with one based on tiling of fused loop nest and one based on a greedy strategy to purely maximize reuse. We show that our methods work better than both of these strategies in most cases for processors such as TMS320Cxx, which have a very limited amount of on-chip memory.

637,A digital fountain approach to asynchronous reliable multicast,"The proliferation of applications that must reliably distribute large, rich content to a vast number of autonomous receivers motivates the design of new multicast and broadcast protocols. We describe an ideal, fully scalable protocol for these applications that we call a digital fountain. A digital fountain allows any number of heterogeneous receivers to acquire content with optimal efficiency at times of their choosing.

1262,The development and evaluation of SHOKE2000: the PCI-based FPGA card,"This paper describes a PCI-based FPGA card, SHOKE2000, which was developed in order to study reconfigurable computing. Since the latest field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) consist of input/output (I/O) configurable blocks as well as internal configurable logic blocks, they not only realize various user logic circuits but also connect with popular I/O standards easily. These features enable FPGA to connect several devices with different interfaces, and thus new reconfigurable systems would be realizable by connecting the FPGA with devices such as digital signal processors (DSP) and analog devices. This paper describes the basic functions of SHOKE2000, which was developed for realizing hybrid reconfigurable systems consisting of FPGA, DSP, and analog devices.

However, the large volumes of code being run, plus the limited access to the internal nodes of the chip, make it very difficult to characterize the nature of any failures that occur. We describe how temporal logic model checking was used to quickly characterize a design error exhibited during hardware testing of a PowerPC microprocessor.

Single test evaluation of segmental metabolism, function and contractile reserve in patients with coronary artery disease and regional dysfunction","/sup 18/F-fluorodeoxyglucose (/sup 18/F-FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) provides information about myocardial glucose metabolism to diagnose myocardial viability. Additional information about the functional status is necessary. Comparison of tomographic metabolic PET with data from other imaging techniques is always hampered by some transfer uncertainty and scatter. We wanted to evaluate a new Fourier-based ECG-gated PET technique using a high resolution scanner providing both metabolic and functional data with respect to feasibility in patients with diseased left ventricles. Forty-five patients with coronary artery disease and at least one left ventricular segment with severe hypokinesis or akinesis at biplane cineventriculography were included. A new Fourier-based ECG-gated metabolic /sup 18/F-FDG-PET was performed in these patients. Function at rest and /sup 18/F-FDG uptake were examined in the PET study using a 36-segment model. Segmental comparison with ventriculography revealed a high reliability in identifying dysfunctional segments (>96%). /sup 18/F-FDG uptake of normokinetic/hypokinetic/akinetic segments was 75.4+or-7.5, 65.3+or-10.5, and 35.9+or-15.2% (p<0.001). In segments >or=70% /sup 18/F-FDG uptake no akinesia was observed. No residual function was found below 40% /sup 18/F-FDG uptake. An additional dobutamine test was performed and revealed inotropic reserve (viability) in 42 akinetic segments and 45 hypokinetic segments. ECG-gated metabolic PET with pixel-based Fourier smoothing provides reliable data on regional function. Assessment of metabolism and function makes complete judgement of segmental status feasible within a single study without any transfer artefacts or test-to-test variability.

Traditional systems require the caller to know the full name of the party. If the caller forgets the name, the system fails to provide service for the caller. In this paper we propose a portable Auto Attendant System (AAS) with sophisticated dialog structure that gives a caller more flexibility while calling. The caller may interact with the system to request a phone number by providing just a work area, specialty, surname, or title, etc. If the party is absent, the system may provide extra information such as where he went, when he will be back, and what he is doing. The system is built modularly, with components such as speech recognizer, language model, dialog manager and text-to-speech that can be replaced if necessary. By simply changing the personnel record database, the system can easily be ported to other companies. The sophisticated dialog manager applies many strategies to allow natural interaction between user and system. Functions such as fuzzy request, user repairing, and extra information query, which are not provided by other systems, are integrated into our system. Experimental results and comparisons to other systems show that our approach provides a more user friendly and natural interaction for auto attendant system","['Auto Attendant System', 'attendant system', 'speech recognizer', 'dialog manager', 'fuzzy request', 'clear request', 'semantic frame', 'spoken dialog systems', 'telephone', 'telephone-based system']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'M', 'U', 'M', 'U', 'M']",

On the defense side, current technologies are still unable to withstand large-scale attacks. The main purpose of this article is therefore twofold.

717,A network simplex algorithm with O(n) consecutive degenerate pivots,"We suggest a pivot rule for the primal simplex algorithm for the minimum cost flow problem, known as the network simplex algorithm. Due to degeneracy, cycling may occur in the network simplex algorithm. The cycling can be prevented by maintaining strongly feasible bases proposed by Cunningham (1976); however, if we do not impose any restrictions on the entering variables, the algorithm can still perform an exponentially long sequence of degenerate pivots. This phenomenon is known as stalling. Researchers have suggested several pivot rules with the following bounds on the number of consecutive degenerate pivots: m, n/sup 2/, k(k + 1)/2, where n is the number of nodes in the network, m is the number of arcs in the network, and k is the number of degenerate arcs in the basis. (Observe that k <or= n.) In this paper, we describe an anti-stalling pivot rule that ensures that the network simplex algorithm performs at most k consecutive degenerate pivots.

Effect-volume histogram,"With the advent of dose optimization algorithms, predominantly for intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), computer software has progressed beyond the point of being merely a tool at the hands of an expert and has become an active, independent mediator of the dosimetric conflicts between treatment goals and risks. To understand and control the internal decision finding as well as to provide means to influence it, a tool for the analysis of the dose distribution is presented which reveals the decision-making process performed by the algorithm. The internal trade-offs between partial volumes receiving high or low doses are driven by functions which attribute a weight to each volume element. The statistics of the distribution of these weights is cast into an effect-volume histogram (EVH) in analogy to dose-volume histograms. The analysis of the EVH reveals which traits of the optimum dose distribution result from the defined objectives, and which are a random consequence of under- or misspecification of treatment goals. The EVH can further assist in the process of finding suitable objectives and balancing conflicting objectives.

1366,A fuzzy-soft learning vector quantization for control chart pattern recognition,"This paper presents a supervised competitive learning network approach, called a fuzzy-soft learning vector quantization, for control chart pattern recognition. Unnatural patterns in control charts mean that there are some unnatural causes for variations in statistical process control (SPC). Hence, control chart pattern recognition becomes more important in SPC. In order to detect effectively the patterns for the six main types of control charts, Pham and Oztemel (1994) described a class of pattern recognizers for control charts based on the learning vector quantization (LVQ) such as LVQ, LVQ2 and LVQ-X etc. In this paper, we propose a new supervised LVQ for control charts based on a fuzzy-soft competitive learning network. The proposed fuzzy-soft LVQ (FS-LVQ) uses a fuzzy relaxation technique and simultaneously updates all neurons. It can increase correct recognition accuracy and also decrease the learning time. Comparisons between LVQ, LVQ-X and FS-LVQ are made","['fuzzy-soft learning vector quantization', 'control chart pattern recognition', 'supervised competitive learning network approach', 'unnatural patterns', 'statistical process control', 'SPC', 'supervised LVQ', 'fuzzy relaxation technique', 'correct recognition accuracy', 'learning time', 'simultaneous neuron update', 'numerical results', 'manufacturing process']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'U', 'M']",

A generalized version of the integrate-and-fire model is presented that qualitatively reproduces firing rates and membrane trajectories of motoneurons. The description is based on the spike-response model and includes three different time constants: the passive membrane time constant, a recovery time of the input conductance after each spike, and a time constant of the spike afterpotential. The effect of stochastic background input on the peristimulus time histogram (PSTH) response to spike input is calculated analytically. Model results are compared with the experimental data of Poliakov et al. (1996). The linearized theory shows that the PSTH response to an input spike is proportional to a filtered version of the postsynaptic potential generated by the input spike. The shape of the filter depends on the background activity. The full nonlinear theory is in close agreement with simulated PSTH data","['PSTH', 'integrate-and-fire model', 'motoneuron', 'firing rates', 'membrane trajectories', 'spike-response model', 'passive membrane time constant', 'recovery time', 'spike afterpotential']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P']",

1147,Angular disparity in ETACT scintimammography,"Emission tuned aperture computed tomography (ETACT) has been previously shown to have the potential for the detection of small tumors (<1 cm) in scintimammography. However, the optimal approach to the application of ETACT in the clinic has yet to be determined. Therefore, we sought to determine the effect of the angular disparity between the ETACT projections on image quality through the use of a computer simulation. A small, spherical tumor of variable size (5, 7.5 or 10 mm) was placed at the center of a hemispherical breast (15 cm diameter). The tumor to nontumor ratio was either 5:1 or 10:1. The detector was modeled to be a gamma camera fitted with a 4-mm-diam pinhole collimator. The pinhole-to-detector and the pinhole-to-tumor distances were 25 and 15 cm, respectively. A ray tracing technique was used to generate three sets of projections (10 degrees , 15 degrees , and 20 degrees , angular disparity). These data were blurred to a resolution consistent with the 4 mm pinhole. The TACT reconstruction method was used to reconstruct these three image sets. The tumor contrast and the axial spatial resolution was measured. Smaller angular disparity led to an improvement in image contrast but at a cost of degraded axial spatial resolution. The improvement in contrast is due to a slight improvement in the in-plane spatial resolution. Since improved contrast should lead to better tumor detectability, smaller angular disparity should be used. However, the difference in contrast between 10 degrees and 15 degrees was very slight and therefore a reasonable clinical choice for angular disparity is 15 degrees","['angular disparity', 'small tumors', 'image quality', 'computer simulation', 'spherical tumor', 'hemispherical breast', 'gamma camera', 'pinhole collimator', 'pinhole-to-tumor distances', 'ray tracing technique', 'image sets', 'axial spatial resolution', 'in-plane spatial resolution', 'clinical choice', 'emission tuned aperture computed tomography scintimammography', 'pinhole-to-detector distances', 'tuned aperture computed tomography reconstruction method']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'R', 'R']",
1102,Design and implementation of a reusable and extensible HL7 encoding/decoding framework,"The Health Level Seven (HL7), an international standard for electronic data exchange in all health care environments, enables disparate computer applications to exchange key sets of clinical and administrative information. Above all, it defines the standard HL7 message formats prescribed by the standard encoding rules. In this paper, we propose a flexible, reusable, and extensible HL7 encoding and decoding framework using a message object model (MOM) and message definition repository (MDR). The MOM provides an abstract HL7 message form represented by a group of objects and their relationships. It reflects logical relationships among the standard HL7 message elements such as segments, fields, and components, while enforcing the key structural constraints imposed by the standard. Since the MOM completely eliminates the dependency of the HL7 encoder and decoder on platform-specific data formats, it makes it possible to build the encoder and decoder as reusable standalone software components, enabling the interconnection of arbitrary heterogeneous hospital information systems (HIS) with little effort. Moreover, the MDR, an external database of key definitions for HL7 messages, helps make the encoder and decoder as resilient as possible to future modifications of the standard HL7 message formats. It is also used by the encoder and decoder to perform a well-formedness check for their respective inputs (i.e., HL7 message objects expressed in the MOM and encoded HL7 message strings). Although we implemented a prototype version of the encoder and decoder using JAVA, they can be easily packaged and delivered as standalone components using the standard component frameworks","['Health Level Seven', 'international standard', 'electronic data exchange', 'health care environments', 'administrative information', 'HL7 message formats', 'HIS', 'message object model', 'MOM', 'message definition repository', 'MDR', 'logical relationships', 'structural constraints', 'standalone software components', 'heterogeneous hospital information systems', 'external database', 'key definitions', 'JAVA', 'reusable framework', 'extensible encoding/decoding framework', 'abstract message form', 'ActiveX', 'JAVABEAN', 'CORBA', 'clinical information']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'U', 'U', 'U', 'R']",
938,Fast accurate MEG source localization using a multilayer perceptron trained with real brain noise,"Iterative gradient methods such as Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) are in widespread use for source localization from electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals. Unfortunately, LM depends sensitively on the initial guess, necessitating repeated runs. This, combined with LM's high per-step cost, makes its computational burden quite high. To reduce this burden, we trained a multilayer perceptron (MLP) as a realtime localizer. We used an analytical model of quasistatic electromagnetic propagation through a spherical head to map randomly chosen dipoles to sensor activities according to the sensor geometry of a 4D Neuroimaging Neuromag-122 MEG system, and trained a MLP to invert this mapping in the absence of noise or in the presence of various sorts of noise such as white Gaussian noise, correlated noise, or real brain noise. A MLP structure was chosen to trade off computation and accuracy. This MLP was trained four times, with each type of noise. We measured the effects of initial guesses on LM performance, which motivated a hybrid MLP-start-LM method, in which the trained MLP initializes LM. We also compared the localization performance of LM, MLPs, and hybrid MLP-start-LMs for realistic brain signals. Trained MLPs are much faster than other methods, while the hybrid MLP-start-LMs are faster and more accurate than fixed-4-start-LM. In particular, the hybrid MLP-start-LM initialized by a MLP trained with the real brain noise dataset is 60 times faster and is comparable in accuracy to random-20-start-LM, and this hybrid system (localization error: 0.28 cm, computation time: 36 ms) shows almost as good performance as optimal-1-start-LM (localization error: 0.23 cm, computation time: 22 ms), which initializes LM with the correct dipole location. MLPs trained with noise perform better than the MLP trained without noise, and the MLP trained with real brain noise is almost as good an initial guesser for LM as the correct dipole location","['MEG source localization', 'multilayer perceptron', 'real brain noise', 'iterative gradient methods', 'analytical model', 'quasistatic electromagnetic propagation', 'spherical head', 'white Gaussian noise', 'correlated noise', 'fast accurate localization', 'real-time localizer', 'computation accuracy', 'Levenberg-Marquardt method', 'forward model']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'M', 'R', 'R', 'M']",

The relationship between main hemodynamic parameters,"The severity of coronary arterial stenosis is usually measured by either simple geometrical parameters, such as percent diameter stenosis, or hemodynamically based parameters, such as the fractional flow reserve (FFR) or coronary flow reserve (CFR). The present study aimed to establish a relationship between actual hemodynamic conditions and the parameters that define stenosis severity in the clinical setting. We used a computational model of the blood flow in a vessel with a blunt stenosis and an autoregulated vascular bed to simulate a stenosed blood vessel. A key point in creating realistic simulations is to properly model arterial autoregulation. A constant flow regulation mechanism resulted in CFR and FFR values that were within the physiological range, while a constant wall-shear stress model yielded unrealistic values.

As a generalization, we focus on the problem of maximizing the total flow value of a generalized flow in N with gains gamma (a) > 0 (a in A) where any arc-flow is bounded by a fixed proportion of the total flow value, where gamma (a)f(a) units arrive at the vertex w for each arc-flow f(a) (a identical to ( upsilon , w) in A) entering vertex upsilon in a generalized flow. Our main results are to propose two polynomial algorithms for this problem. The first algorithm runs in O(mM(n, m, B') log B) time, where B is the maximum absolute value among integral values used by an instance of the problem, and M(n, m, B') denotes the complexity of solving a generalized maximum flow problem in a network with n vertices, and m arcs, and a rational instance expressed with integers between 1 and B'.

555,Computing transient gating charge movement of voltage-dependent ion channels,"The opening of voltage-gated sodium, potassium, and calcium ion channels has a steep relationship with voltage. In response to changes in the transmembrane voltage, structural movements of an ion channel that precede channel opening generate a capacitative gating current. The net gating charge displacement due to membrane depolarization is an index of the voltage sensitivity of the ion channel activation process. Understanding the molecular basis of voltage-dependent gating of ion channels requires the measurement and computation of the gating charge, Q. We derive a simple and accurate semianalytic approach to computing the voltage dependence of transient gating charge movement (Q-V relationship) of discrete Markov state models of ion channels using matrix methods. This approach allows rapid computation of Q-V curves for finite and infinite length step depolarizations and is consistent with experimentally measured transient gating charge.

Evaluation of synthetic mammogram texture,"We have evaluated a method for synthesizing mammograms by comparing the texture of clinical and synthetic mammograms. The synthesis algorithm is based upon simulations of breast tissue and the mammographic imaging process. Mammogram texture was synthesized by projections of simulated adipose tissue compartments. It was hypothesized that the synthetic and clinical texture have similar properties, assuming that the mammogram texture reflects the 3D tissue distribution. The size of the projected compartments was computed by mathematical morphology. The texture energy and fractal dimension were also computed and analyzed in terms of the distribution of texture features within four different tissue regions in clinical and synthetic mammograms. Comparison of the cumulative distributions of the mean features computed from 95 mammograms showed that the synthetic images simulate the mean features of the texture of clinical mammograms. Correlation of clinical and synthetic texture feature histograms, averaged over all images, showed that the synthetic images can simulate the range of features seen over a large group of mammograms.

The results show that the new and enhanced algorithms identify face sets that previously published algorithms cannot detect. The tests also show that each algorithm can detect, among other types, a certain type of feature that is unique to it. Hence, most of the algorithms discussed in this paper would have to be combined to obtain complete coverage","['feature recognition algorithms', 'general-purpose feature detection techniques', 'face sets', 'National Design Repository', 'convex hull', 'concavity']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'U', 'U']",

568,Modeling cutting temperatures for turning inserts with various tool geometries and materials,"Temperatures are of interest in machining because cutting tools often fail by thermal softening or temperature-activated wear. Many models for cutting temperatures have been developed, but these models consider only simple tool geometries such as a rectangular slab with a sharp corner. This report describes a finite element study of tool temperatures in cutting that accounts for tool nose radius and included angle effects. A temperature correction factor model that can be used in the design and selection of inserts is developed to account for these effects. A parametric mesh generator is used to generate the finite element models of tool and inserts of varying geometries. The steady-state temperature response is calculated using NASTRAN solver. Several finite element analysis (FEA) runs are performed to quantify the effects of inserts included angle, nose radius, and materials for the insert and the tool holder on the cutting temperature at the insert rake face. The FEA results are then utilized to develop a temperature correction factor model that accounts for these effects. The temperature correction factor model is integrated with an analytical temperature model for rectangular inserts to predict cutting temperatures for contour turning with inserts of various shapes and nose radii. Finally, experimental measurements of cutting temperature using the tool-work thermocouple technique are performed and compared with the predictions of the new temperature model. The comparisons show good agreement","['turning inserts', 'tool geometries', 'machining', 'tool nose radius', 'temperature correction factor', 'parametric mesh generator', 'finite element models', 'cutting temperature model', 'insert shape effects']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'R']",

Genetic operations may render the SPT representation of a value noncanonical. A new encoding scheme is introduced to encode the SPT values. In this new scheme, the canonical property of the SPT values is preserved under genetic operations. Additionally, two new features that drastically improve the performance of our GA are introduced. (1) An additional level of natural selection is introduced to simulate the effect of natural selection when sperm cells compete to fertilize an ovule; this dramatically improves the offspring survival rate. A conventional GA is analogous to intracytoplasmic sperm injection and has an extremely low offspring survival rate, resulting in very slow convergence. (2) The probability of mutation for each codon of a chromosome is weighted by the reciprocal of its effect. Because of these new features, the performance of our new GA outperforms conventional GAs","['genetic algorithm', 'quadrature mirror filter', 'lattice filter bank', 'encoding scheme', 'natural selection', 'offspring survival rate', 'signed power-of-two coefficient lattice structure', 'QMF', 'chromosome codon', 'signal processing', 'perfect reconstruction']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'U', 'R', 'U', 'U']",

1364,An adaptive sphere-fitting method for sequential tolerance control,"The machining of complex parts typically involves a logical and chronological sequence of n operations on m machine tools. Because manufacturing datums cannot always match design constraints, some of the design specifications imposed on the part are usually satisfied by distinct subsets of the n operations prescribed in the process plan. Conventional tolerance control specifies a fixed set point for each operation and a permissible variation about this set point to insure compliance with the specifications, whereas sequential tolerance control (STC) uses real-time measurement information at the completion of one stage to reposition the set point for subsequent operations. However, it has been shown that earlier sphere-fitting methods for STC can lead to inferior solutions when the process distributions are skewed. This paper introduces an extension of STC that uses an adaptive sphere-fitting method that significantly improves the yield in the presence of skewed distributions as well as significantly reducing the computational effort required by earlier probabilistic search methods","['adaptive sphere-fitting method', 'sequential tolerance control', 'machine tools', 'design constraints', 'compliance', 'real-time measurement information', 'skewed distributions', 'computational effort', 'yield improvement']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R']",

In this paper various original algorithms for evaluating, in a video distribution system, a statistical estimation of aggregate bandwidth needed by a given number of smoothed video streams are proposed and discussed. The variable bit rate traffic generated by each video stream is characterized by its marginal distribution and by conditional probabilities between rates of temporary closed streams. The developed iterative algorithms evaluate an upper and lower bound of needed bandwidth for guaranteeing a given loss probability.

1449,Raising the standard of management education for electronic commerce professionals,"The teaching of electronic commerce in universities has become a growth industry in itself. The rapid expansion of electronic commerce programmes raises the question of what actually is being taught. The association of electronic commerce as primarily a technical or information technology (IT) phenomenon has not been sufficient to constrain it to IT and information systems departments. Business schools have been keen entrants into the electronic commerce coursework race and they are developing electronic commerce programmes in an environment where there is no agreed definition of the term. This paper draws on the work of Kenneth Boulding who argued that the dynamics of change in society are largely a product of changing skills and the way these skills are arranged into roles at the organizational level. It is argued that an overly technical interpretation of electronic commerce narrows the skills being acquired as part of formal education. Universities, under pressure from the market and technological change, are changing their roles resulting in a further narrowing of the breadth of issues that is seen as legitimate to be included as electronic commerce. The outcome is that aspiring electronic commerce professionals are not being exposed to a wide enough agenda of ideas and concepts that will assist them to make better business decisions","['electronic commerce professionals', 'universities', 'IT', 'information technology', 'information systems', 'business schools', 'Kenneth Boulding', 'organizational level', 'formal education', 'management education standards improvement']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'M']",

The instability behaviour of the gas-metal arc welding (GMAW) process is characterized by strong oscillations in arc length and current. In the paper, a model of the GMAW process is developed using an exact arc voltage characteristic. This model is used to study stability of the self-regulation process and to develop a simulation program that helps to understand the transient or dynamic nature of the GMAW process and relationships among current, electrode extension and contact tube-work distance. The process is shown to exhibit instabilities at both long electrode extension and normal extension. Results obtained from simulation runs of the model were also experimentally confirmed by the present author, as reported in this study. In order to explain the concept of the instability phenomena, the metal transfer mode and the arc voltage-current characteristic were examined. Based on this examination, the conclusion of this study is that their combined effects lead to the oscillations in arc current and length","['instability phenomena', 'gas-metal arc welding', 'self-regulation process', 'arc instability', 'weld quality', 'GMAW process', 'exact arc voltage characteristic', 'metal transfer mode']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P']",
1020,Supersampling multiframe blind deconvolution resolution enhancement of adaptive optics compensated imagery of low earth orbit satellites,We describe a postprocessing methodology for reconstructing undersampled image sequences with randomly varying blur that can provide image enhancement beyond the sampling resolution of the sensor.

Also shown are the results of multiframe blind deconvolution of some of the highest quality optical imagery of low earth orbit satellites collected with a ground-based telescope to date. The algorithm used is a generalization of multiframe blind deconvolution techniques that include a representation of spatial sampling by the focal plane array elements based on a forward stochastic model. This generalization enables the random shifts and shape of the AO-compensated point spread function (PSF) to be used to partially eliminate the aliasing effects associated with sub-Nyquist sampling of the image by the focal plane array.

923,Design and manufacture of a lightweight piezo-composite curved actuator,"In this paper we are concerned with the design, manufacture and performance test of a lightweight piezo-composite curved actuator (called LIPCA) using a top carbon fiber composite layer with near-zero coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), a middle PZT ceramic wafer, and a bottom glass/epoxy layer with a high CTE. The main point of the design for LIPCA is to replace the heavy metal layers of THUNDER TM by lightweight fiber reinforced plastic layers without losing the capabilities for generating high force and large displacement. It is possible to save up to about 40% of the weight if we replace the metallic backing material by the light fiber composite layer. We can also have design flexibility by selecting the fiber direction and the size of prepreg layers. In addition to the lightweight advantage and design flexibility, the proposed device can be manufactured without adhesive layers when we use an epoxy resin prepreg system. Glass/epoxy prepregs, a ceramic wafer with electrode surfaces, and a carbon prepreg were simply stacked and cured at an elevated temperature (177 degrees C) after following an autoclave bagging process. We found that the manufactured composite laminate device had a sufficient curvature after being detached from a flat mould. An analysis method using the classical lamination theory is presented to predict the curvature of LIPCA after curing at an elevated temperature. The predicted curvatures are in quite good agreement with the experimental values. In order to investigate the merits of LIPCA, performance tests of both LIPCA and THUNDER TM have been conducted under the same boundary conditions.

The measurement set-up utilizes the global positioning system satellite constellation in 'common view' between two similar timing stations: one acts as a time server for the other, so the final timing difference at the second station represents the total synch error through the internet. Data recorded over batches of 10000 samples show a typical RMS value of 35 ms.

1218,Knowledge acquisition for expert systems in accounting and financial problem domains,"Since the mid-1980s, expert systems have been developed for a variety of problems in accounting and finance. The most commonly cited problems in developing these systems are the unavailability of the experts and knowledge engineers and difficulties with the rule extraction process. Within the field of artificial intelligence, this has been called the 'knowledge acquisition' (KA) problem and has been identified as a major bottleneck in the expert system development process. Recent empirical research reveals that certain KA techniques are significantly more efficient than others in helping to extract certain types of knowledge within specific problem domains. This paper presents a mapping between these empirical studies and a generic taxonomy of expert system problem domains. To accomplish this, we first examine the range of problem domains and suggest a mapping of accounting and finance tasks to a generic problem domain taxonomy. We then identify and describe the most prominent KA techniques employed in developing expert systems in accounting and finance.

First, cerebrum segmentation from a midsagittal brain MR image is performed utilizing landmarks, anatomical information, and a connectivity-based threshold segmentation algorithm as previously reported. Recognizing that the cerebrum in laterally adjacent slices tends to have similar size and shape, we use the cerebrum segmentation result from the midsagittal brain MR image as a mask to guide cerebrum segmentation in adjacent lateral slices in an iterative fashion. This masking operation yields a masked image (preliminary cerebrum segmentation) for the next lateral slice, which may truncate brain region(s). Truncated regions are restored by first finding end points of their boundaries, by comparing the mask image and masked image boundaries, and then applying a connectivity-based algorithm. The resulting final extracted cerebrum image for this slice is then used as a mask for the next lateral slice.

846,Female computer science doctorates: what does the survey of earned doctorates reveal?,"Based on the National Center for Education Statistics (2000), in the 1997-1998 academic year 26.7% of earned bachelors' degrees, 29.0% of earned masters' degrees and 16.3% of earned doctorates' degrees in computer science were awarded to women. As these percentages suggest, women are underrepresented at all academic levels in computer science (Camp, 1997). The most severe shortage occurs at the top level-the doctorate in computer science. We know very little about the women who persist to the top level of academic achievement in computer science. This paper examines a subset of data collected through the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED). The specific focus of this paper is to identify trends that have emerged from the SED with respect to females completing doctorates in computer science between the academic years 1990-1991 and 1999-2000. Although computer science doctorates include doctorates in information science, prior research (Camp, 1997) suggests that the percentage of women completing doctorates in information science as compared to computer science is low. The specific research questions are: 1. How does the percentage of women who complete doctorates in computer science compare to those that complete doctorates in other fields? 2. How does the length of time in school and the sources of funding differ for females as compared to males who complete doctorates in computer science? 3. Where do women go after completing doctorates in computer science and what positions do they acquire? How do these experiences differ from their male peers?","['female computer science doctorates', 'Survey of Earned Doctorates', 'information science']","['P', 'P', 'P']",

1415,The disconnect continues [digital content providers],"The relationships between the people who buy digital content and those who sell it are probably more acrimonious than ever before, says Dick Curtis, a director and lead analyst for the research firm Outsell Inc., where he covers econtent contract and negotiation strategies. Several buyers agree with his observation. They cite aggressive sales tactics, an unwillingness to deliver content in formats buyers need, a reluctance to provide licensing terms that take into account the structure of today's corporations, and inadequate service and support as a few of the factors underlying the acrimony. Still, many buyers remain optimistic that compromises can be reached on some of these issues. But first, they say, sellers must truly understand the econtent needs of today's enterprises","['digital content', 'econtent contract', 'sales tactics', 'econtent negotiation', 'econtent buyers', 'news databases', 'Web site']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'R', 'U', 'U']",
1081,Stability of W-methods with applications to operator splitting and to geometric theory,"We analyze the stability properties of W-methods applied to the parabolic initial value problem u' + Au = Bu. We work in an abstract Banach space setting, assuming that A is the generator of an analytic semigroup and that B is relatively bounded with respect to A. Since W-methods treat the term with A implicitly, whereas the term involving B is discretized in an explicit way, they can be regarded as splitting methods. As an application of our stability results, convergence for nonsmooth initial data is shown. Moreover, the layout of a geometric theory for discretizations of semilinear parabolic problems u' + Au = f (u) is presented","['operator splitting', 'geometric theory', 'parabolic initial value problem', 'abstract Banach space', 'analytic semigroup', 'nonsmooth initial data', 'W-methods stability', 'linearly implicit Runge-Kutta methods']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'M']",

1338,The chromatic spectrum of mixed hypergraphs,"A mixed hypergraph is a triple H = (X, C, D), where X is the vertex set, and each of C, D is a list of subsets of X. A strict k-coloring of H is a surjection c : X {1,..., k} such that each member of le has two vertices assigned a common value and each member of D has two vertices assigned distinct values. The feasible set of H is {k: H has a strict k-coloring}. Among other results, we prove that a finite set of positive integers is the feasible set of some mixed hypergraph if and only if it omits the number I or is an interval starting with 1. For the set {s, t} with 2 <or= s <or= t - 2, the smallest realization has 2t - s vertices. When every member of C union D is a single interval in an underlying linear order on the vertices, the feasible set is also a single interval of integers","['chromatic spectrum', 'mixed hypergraphs', 'mixed hypergraphs', 'vertex set', 'strict k-coloring', 'positive integers', 'mixed hypergraph']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P']",

790,Data assimilation of local model error forecasts in a deterministic model,"One of the most popular data assimilation techniques in use today are of the Kalman filter type, which provide an improved estimate of the state of a system up to the current time level, based on actual measurements. From a forecasting viewpoint, this corresponds to an updating of the initial conditions. The standard forecasting procedure is to then run the model uncorrected into the future, driven by predicted boundary and forcing conditions. The problem with this methodology is that the updated initial conditions quickly 'wash-out', thus, after a certain forecast horizon the model predictions are no better than from an initially uncorrected model. This study demonstrates that through the assimilation of error forecasts (in the present case made using so-called local models) entire model domains can be corrected for extended forecast horizons (i.e. long after updated initial conditions have become washed-out), thus demonstrating significant improvements over the conventional methodology. Some alternate uses of local models are also explored for the re-distribution of error forecasts over the entire model domain, which are then compared with more conventional Kalman filter type schemes","['data assimilation', 'local model error forecasts', 'deterministic model', 'Kalman filter', 'forcing conditions', 'forecast horizon', 'error prediction', 'hydrodynamic modelling']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'M']",
1380,A feature-preserving volumetric technique to merge surface triangulations,"Several extensions and improvements to surface merging procedures based on the extraction of isosurfaces from a distance map defined on an adaptive background grid are presented. The main objective is to extend the application of these algorithms to surfaces with sharp edges and comers. In order to deal with objects of different length scales, the initial background grids are created using a Delaunay triangulation method and local voxelizations. A point enrichment technique that introduces points into the background grid along detected surface features such as ridges is used to ensure that these features are preserved in the final merged surface. The surface merging methodology is extended to include other Boolean operations between surface triangulations. The iso-surface extraction algorithms are modified to obtain the correct iso-surface for multi-component objects. The procedures are demonstrated with various examples, ranging from simple geometrical entities to complex engineering applications. The present algorithms allow realistic modelling of a large number of complex engineering geometries using overlapping components defined discretely, i.e. via surface triangulations.

A question is answered in the negative inquiring whether theories of hereditarily finite superstructures which have a unique (up to isomorphism) hereditarily finite superstructure can be described via definable functions. Yet theories for such superstructures admit a description in terms of iterated families TF and SF. These are constructed using a definable union taken over countable ordinals in the subsets which are unions of finitely many complete subsets and of finite subsets, respectively. Simultaneously, we describe theories that share a unique (up to isomorphism) countable hereditarily finite superstructure","['model theory', 'model-theoretic properties', 'countable signatures', 'iterated families', 'definable union', 'finitely many complete subsets', 'countable hereditarily finite superstructure']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P']",

However, most documents available from the Web are in HTML form which is originally designed for document formatting with little consideration of its contents. Effectively extracting data from such documents remains a nontrivial task. In this paper, we present a schema-guided approach to extracting data from HTML pages. Under the approach, the user defines a schema specifying what to be extracted and provides sample mappings between the schema and the HTML page. The system will induce the mapping rules and generate a wrapper that takes the HTML page as input and produces the required data in the form of XML conforming to the user-defined schema. A prototype system implementing the approach has been developed. The preliminary experiments indicate that the proposed semi-automatic approach is not only easy to use but also able to produce a wrapper that extracts required data from inputted pages with high accuracy","['data extraction', 'schema', 'Internet', 'information source', 'HTML', 'wrapper generation', 'data integration', 'distributed database', 'queries']","['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'R', 'M', 'U', 'U']",
118,Sensorless control of induction motor drives,"Controlled induction motor drives without mechanical speed sensors at the motor shaft have the attractions of low cost and high reliability. To replace the sensor the information on the rotor speed is extracted from measured stator voltages and currents at the motor terminals. Vector-controlled drives require estimating the magnitude and spatial orientation of the fundamental magnetic flux waves in the stator or in the rotor. Open-loop estimators or closed-loop observers are used for this purpose. They differ with respect to accuracy, robustness, and sensitivity against model parameter variations. Dynamic performance and steady-state speed accuracy in the low-speed range can be achieved by exploiting parasitic effects of the machine.

635,Detection and estimation of abrupt changes in the variability of a process,"Detection of change-points in normal means is a well-studied problem. The parallel problem of detecting changes in variance has had less attention. The form of the generalized likelihood ratio test statistic has long been known, but its null distribution resisted exact analysis. In this paper, we formulate the change-point problem for a sequence of chi-square random variables. We describe a procedure that is exact for the distribution of the likelihood ratio statistic for all even degrees of freedom, and gives upper and lower bounds for odd (and also for non-integer) degrees of freedom. Both the liberal and conservative bounds for chi /sub 1//sup 2/ degrees of freedom are shown through simulation to be reasonably tight. The important problem of testing for change in the normal variance of individual observations corresponds to the chi /sub 1//sup 2/ case. The non-null case is also covered, and confidence intervals for the true change point are derived. The methodology is illustrated with an application to quality control in a deep level gold mine.
